In practice, tick marks are usually called prime marks (and probably will effectively/culturally have a value of C=1); other distinguishing features are employed usually once these are used, such as overbars, over-tildes/over-twiddles, dagger, asterisks, etc. For a fixed C, this operator forms a series in B for each A. The meaning is context-specific. B = 0 iff C = 0; if A in unprimed (lacks any distinguishing marks), then B = 0; thus all mathematical objects have this operator implicitly attached to them with the value of 0 for the second and third argumentsize (note that this is not the default value for these arguments when this operator is explicitly mentioned).

Thus, the indices/labels specified are included in the range of sampling; id est: if the matrix entries listed belong to the ith row and jth column and the (i+n)th row and (j+m)th column respectively (for positive integers i,j,n,m), then the sampling will be conducted in all rows of number between (and including) i and i+n (yielding n+1 sampled rows) and in all columns of number between (and including) j and j+m (yielding m+1 sampled columns). The default diagonal sampling procedure for x4 is as follows: The first sampled entry has the minimum allowed (as specified in x3) indices.  All latter sampled entries (by default) have indices of the immediately previous sampled entry each augmented by 1. (Which is to say that if the kth sampled entry has indices (x,y,...), in that order, then the (k+1)th sampled entry has indices (x+1,y+1,...), in that order and where each subsequent index would be the respective index of the kth sampled entry augmented by 1).  The process terminates generally whenever exactly one entry is sampled from each of the rows, each of the columns, etc. of the tensor.  In the default, the process terminates when at least one of the indices of a sampled entry of the tensor is as large as possible in the range specified by x3. Thus, in order to reconcile the general and the default termination conditions, the range specified by x3 must be compatible with both; id est: it must be a r-dimensional hypercube of entries, so to speak, where r is the rank of tensor x2. The default for sampling range x3 is between and including the entry in the first row and first column (etc.) and the entry in the last row and last column (etc.) for an r-dimensional hypercube tensor (meaning that each row, column, etc. of the tensor has exactly the same number of entries as the others).  Generally, the default range begins with the entry of indices each minimal in the tensor (called 'the first entry') and extends to include (\"draw\") the maximal r-dimensional hypercube of entries in the tensor with one vertex on the first entry; in other words, if the minimum of the set of maximal indices in the tensor is g, then the sampling range is every row between the first and the gth, every column between the first and the gth, etc.  Generally, the sampling range must be an r-dimensional orthotope of some positive size (that is to say: including at least one entry) no larger than the tensor itself, but with the freedom to place at most r of its vertices among the entries thereof; if the default sampling procedure x4 is being used, then the r-dimensional orthotope must be an r-dimensional hypercube. Generalizes to any tensor, but is only interesting for tensors of rank at least 1. Any mention of geometric terminology (such as mention of diagonals, orthotopes, etc.) in the definition or notes of this word should be interpreted cautiously and is not necessarily good Lojbanic practice; such terminology should not necessarily be emulated in practicing Lojbanic thought or speech.

This word must be followed by a sumti; for the purpose of this explanation, this sumti will be xy (as in \"de'ai xy\").  The affected terbri is defined to default to the value xy (the sumti as a whole, including gadri, tanru, relative clauses, etc.); in other words, when not explicitly filled or when filled be {di'au}, the sumti value filling the affected terbri is that of xy.  This affect remains in effect until the end of the text/conversation or until/unless the default setting of this terbri explicitly redefined (overriding by {di'ei} is temporary/only applies to that usage). If xy is {zo'e}, the default value is completely general and elliptical; thus, permanently overriding a default setting on a specific terbri may be done by \"de'ai zo'e\". The scope of this word fully encompasses and ends with the following sumti (xy); thus, the second sumti, same-/higher-level terminator, a FA cmavo, etc. following this word ends the new default specification in addition to its other functions.  Additionally, this word does not actually fill the affected terbri with any particular sumti/value; it merely defines its default value hereinafter. CAUTION: Thus, the second same-level sumti uttered actually fills the affected terbri; in order to access the newly-defined default value of the terbri immediately after definition, follow \"xy\" (with terminator) immediately with implicit (or possibly explicit) \"{zo'e}\" (possibly necessitating terminators), \"{di'au}\", or \"xy\" itself. Moreover, therefore, the default value defined by this word does not immediately/necessarily affect the truth value of the statement in which it appears (it only does so if the second following sumti is not {di'au}, implicit (or possibly) explicit {zo'e}, or xy itself); however, in all future uses of the brivla to which the terbri belongs, unless explicitly filled with a sumti of a different value, the truth value of those statements will be affected.  Also, {su} does not erase this new definition of default. If the affected terbri is naturally defined to have a default or if it has no naturally defined default value, this word semi-permanently over-writes them.

The terbri are not filled by this word. Usage is only meaningful for a brivla with at least one terbri (regardless of being explicitly filled or otherwise). In a tanru or other complicated construct, only the most recent word undergoes this terbri default override (not every term in the construct).

Thus, there is no simple way to reference the \"general\" elliptical/unspecified value for these sumti, other than by using this word.  {zo'e} typically is interpreted as meaning any value of some general and unspecified set of potential sumti referents, modulated by context and the need to make the statement true; in the case of an explicit default setting of a terbri by the definition of a word, {di'ei} takes on this general and unspecified meaning, effectively ignoring the default (although it can take on the value of that default (doing so, simply, is just not necessary)); when no default is specified for the terbri in the definition, this word has the same meaning as {zo'e}.

For example, \"li pa ce'o li re\" means \"big-endian\" (the most significant term (represented by \"li pa\") comes first in the sequence and the sequence has exactly two terms), \"li re ce'o li pa\" means \"little-endian\" ((the most significant term (represented by \"li pa\") comes last in the sequence and the sequence has exactly two terms), \"li re ce'o li ci ce'o le pa\" is middle-endian (as in the conventional representation of dates in the U.S. (MM-DD-YYYY); the second most signifant term (represented by \"li re\"; example: month) comes first, the least significant term (represented by \"li ci\"; example: day) comes second, and the most significant term (represented by \"li pa\"; example: year) comes last, and there are exactly three terms), \"li pa ce'o li ci ce'o li re\" is the reverse of the last (example: YYYY-DD-MM). The point is that, while it is cumbersome, this method of filling $x_2$ is generalizable and explicit. \"Bi-endian\" (traditional sense) can be specified by a judicious usage of the word \".{a}\" between the little-endian and big-endian sequences; less conventional endiannesses which could be described as being \"bi-endian\" or even \"$n$-endian\" can be formed by different or more elaborate connectives between such sequences; just worry about grouping of connectives.

Units are not considered to be prime factors for the purposes of this counting. $x_2$ toggles the type of counting and must be exactly one element of Set$(-1, 0, 1)$. If $x_2 = -1$ and $X_3$ is the typical ring of integers (with the ordering here being the traditional ordering of the integers), then the output is $k =$ sup$($Set$(i: i$ is a positive integer, and $v_{p_i}(X_1) > 0))$, where: $p_i$ is the $i$th prime (such that $p_1 = 2$), and $v_p$ is the $p$-adic valuation (see: \"{pau'au}\") of the input; in other words, this mode yields the index $i$ of the greatest prime $p_i$ which has a nonzero power $r_i$ such that $p_i^{r_i}$ divides $X_1$; if $X_1$ is a unit and $x_2 = -1$, then this word outputs $0$; if $X_1 = 0$ and $X_2 = -1$, then this word outputs positive infinity; this mode counts early primes which have power $0$ in the prime factorization of $X_1$ but does not count the infinitely many later ones which occur after the last nonzero prime power in that factorization (when $X_1$ is not $0$ and is not a unit). If $X_2 = 0$, then the prime factors with nonzero power are counted without multiplicity (they are counted only uniquely and according to their distinctness, ignoring their exponents unless such is $0$ (in which case, it is not counted)); in other words, under this condition, this word would function as the number-theoretic prime little-omega function LittleOmega$(x_1) =$ Sum$_{p|X_1} (1)$, where: the summation is taken over all $p$, such that all of the bound $p$ must be prime, and \"$|$\" denotes divisibility of the term on the right (second term) by the term on the left (first term).

No other option for the value of $X_2$ is currently defined. $X_2$ might have contextual/cultural/conventional defaults, but the contextless default value is $X_2 = 1$. $X_3$ specifies the (algebraic) structure in which primehood/factoring is being considered/performed (equipped also with an ordering of the primes); it need not be specified if the context is clear; if such is sensible for the other inputs, the contextless default for $X_3$ is the typical ring of integers (with the ordering being the traditional ordering of the integers and the 1st prime being $p_1 = 2$).
