For example in English: \"I ain't seen nothin'\" means that the speaker is very emphatically claiming to have seen nothing of interest. This is the standard operation for negation in Spanish. \"Multiplicative negation\" means that negatives cancel, but do not intensify, one another (possibly taking a neutral or abstentional state). \"I did not see nothing\" in this mode means that the speaker did indeed see something. Note that multiplicative double-negatives are not necessarily equivalent to affirmatives in general. \"I like cheese\" is an affirmative statement and is not equivalent to \"I do not dislike cheese\", which is a multiplicative double-negative (and which may indicate a reluctant acceptance of cheese or a neutral feeling toward cheese). In this mode, an even number of negatives in a given statement is not negative and an odd number of negatives in a given statement is not positive. This word applies to all negatives in the text, whether they are free words or rafsi. This word also, but less dramatically, applies to affirmations: in additive mode, multiple affirmatives intensify one another (\"I am indeed very much so going!\" is a strongly emphasized positive statement); in multiplicative mode, they simply reduce to a single affirmation (for like example, \"I am going\"). This means that care must be taken: In additive mode, an affirmative marker will partially cancel with a negative particle in some way, reducing its intensity and possibly bringing it to a neutral statement (\"I am indeed - not - going\" is a neutral statement in this mode, similar to \"I may be going\"; English does not really have the ability to express such things); in multiplicative mode, an affirmative coupled with a negative simply reduces to the negative, possibly strengthened by a factor equivalent to the intensity of the affirmer (\"I am indeed not going\" is a clear way of saying that the speaker will not go).","experimental cmavo",["double-negative mode toggle"],"","","NEIhAI"],["nei'au","unary mekso operator: $(-1)^x$","Macro for exponentiating -1 by the input, which is an extremely common term.

For the purposes of this description, suppose temporarily that the base is decimal/ten; this is for simplicity - statements generalize to other bases. The zeroth digit ($X_2$ = $0$) is the singles digit; the first digit ($X_2$ = $1$) is the tens digit; the $n$th digit (for any integer $n$) is the digit which represents the multiple of ${10}^{n}$; the positive-last ($X_2$ = {ma'uro}) digit is the most significant digit/figure in a finite number expressed in decimal; the negative-first ($X_2$ = $-1$) is the one-tenths digit; the negative-last digit for a terminating expansion in decimal is the least significant digit/figure of the number when expressed in decimal. Only macrodigits are extracted; so, in Roman numeral notation, decimal 120 = CXX, and the second (or positive-last) digit is C (which equals 100). $X_1$ may be expressed in any base but $X_3$ forces a conversion to its own base for the purposes of this extraction; $X_1$, $X_2$, $X_3$, and the result of the extraction may all be expressed in any base (independent of one another) and the default is assumed to be default of the cultural context for the math (according to the CLL, this is usually decimal), explicitly differing from this base requires {ju'u} or similar (which is allowed). The result/output of this function is a digit (thus, it concatenates with other PA automatically) and must filter through the interpretation rules in order to be considered a number; unless it explicitly expressed otherwise, it is assumed to be in the base of whatever digit-string it occurs in or, failing this/being alone, the base used in the cultural context of the text - it is not necessarily expressed in base-$X_3$.","experimental cmavo",["digit extraction"],"","","VUhU"],["pidu'e","number: too much of.","","cmavo-compound",["too much of"],"","","PA*"],["pi'ei","mathematical/mekso binary operator: vector or function inner product over a field; the inner product of A and B over field C","The field is usually defined or implicitly clear from context.

The number of polytope 'tiles' used can be specified in the third of fifth terbri as desired; the polytopes used need not all be the same, nor regular, so long as the arrangement is meaningful and possible. One of the main differences between rectangular polyplets and polyominoes is that polyominoes cannot have their polytope tiles touching only at their vertices whereas polyplets can (thus, polyominoes are a subset of the rectangular polyplets); this difference can be specified in the final terbri. A tiling of a space may be considered to be an infinite polyform, but that is rather pathological and we can reasonably assume that polyforms referenced by this word will be finite. The polyform is considered to be a unified whole entity. The ambient space is usually going to be the Euclidean space of the same dimension as the polytopes (and the former dimension cannot be exceeded by the latter except in the marginal case of lower-dimensional (id est: hyperplanar) arrangements, in which case parallel cross-sections are really being considered); this space determines the rigid-motion/symmetry isomorphisms of various polyforms (Z and S tetraminoes are non-isomorphic under rigid-motion in the Euclidean plane but are so isomorphic in Euclidean 3-space). The ambient space also determines the expression of (and indeed the 'allowed') polytopes: spherical geometry allows for digons to be arranged so as to form a polyform, but Euclidean 2-space prohibits such objects from the set of possible polygons. The default polytope will probably be a 2-dimensional square; thus the default ambient space will likely be Euclidean 2-space.
