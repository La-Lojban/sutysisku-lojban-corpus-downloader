Making Type 4 {fu'ivla} (or {zi'evla}), on the other hand, presents the challenge of knowing, out of hundreds of wordlike phonological patterns, which will parse as  single-morpheme words and which will not. (For example, the nonce word {kadvati} will parse but *{kazvati} will not; {fra'aso} will but *{fra'asoi} will not; {kadnazbakai} will but {kadnazbackai} is a actually a lujvo.) Making Type 3 fu'ivla is comparatively easy, but still requires knowing how to use hyphen phonemes right and, of course, how to not violate phonotactical rules when lojbanizing foreign words.

When the argument of $x_4$ is 1, the generalized eigenspace $x_3$ is simply a strict/simple/basic eigenspace; this is the typical (and probable cultural default) meaning of this word. $x_4$ will typically be restricted to integer values k > 0. $x_2$ should always be specified (at least implicitly by context), for an eigenvalue does not mean much without the linear transformation being known. However, since one usually knows the said linear transformation, and since the basic underlying relationship of this word is \"eigen-ness\", the eigenvalue is given the primary terbri ($x_1$). When filling $x_3$ and/or $x_4$, $x_2$ and $x_1$ (in that order of importance) should already be (at least contextually implicitly) specified. $x_3$ is the set of all eigenvectors of linear transformation $x_2$, endowed with all of the typical operations of the vector space at hand. The default includes the zero vector (else the $x_3$ eigenspace is not actually a vector space); normally in the context of mathematics, the zero vector is not considered to be an eigenvector, but by this definition it is included. Thus, a Lojban mathematician would consider the zero vector to be an (automatic) eigenvector of the given (in fact, any) linear transformation (particularly ones represented by a square matrix in a given basis). This is the logically most basic definition, but is contrary to typical mathematical culture. This word implies neither nondegeneracy nor degeneracy of eigenspace $x_3$. In other words there may or may not be more than one linearly independent vector in the eigenspace $x_3$ for a given eigenvalue $x_1$ of linear transformation $x_2$. $x_3$ is the unique generalized eigenspace of $x_2$ for given values of $x_1$ and $x_4$. $x_1$ is not necessarily the unique eigenvalue of linear transformation $x_2$, nor is its multiplicity necessarily 1 for the same. Beware when converting the terbri structure of this word. In fact, the set of all eigenvalues for a given linear transformation $x_2$ will include scalar zero (0); therefore, any linear transformation with a nontrivial set of eigenvalues will have at least two eigenvalues that may fill in terbri $x_1$ of this word. The 'eigenvalue' of zero for a proper/nice linear transformation will produce an 'eigenspace' that is equivalent to the entire vector space at hand. If $x_3$ is specified by a set of vectors, the span of that set should fully yield the entire eigenspace of the linear transformation $x_2$ associated with eigenvalue $x_1$, however the set may be redundant (linearly dependent); the zero vector is automatically included in any vector space. A multidimensional eigenspace (that is to say a vector space of eigenvectors with dimension strictly greater than 1) for fixed eigenvalue and linear transformation (and generalization exponent) is degenerate by definition. The algebraic multiplicity $x_5$ of the eigenvalue does not entail degeneracy (of eigenspace) if greater than 1; it is the integer number of occurrences of a given eigenvalue $x_1$ in the multiset of eigenvalues (spectrum) of the given linear transformation/square matrix $x_2$. In other words, the characteristic polynomial can be factored into linear polynomial primes (with root $x_1$) which are exponentiated to the power $x_5$ (the multiplicity; notably, not $x_4$). For $x_4$ > $x_5$, the eigenspace is trivial. $x_2$ may not be diagonalizable. The scalar zero (0) is a naturally permissible argument of $x_1$ (unlike some cultural mathematical definitions in English). Eigenspaces retain the operations and properties endowing the vectorspaces to which they belong (as subspaces). Thus, an eigenspace is more than a set of objects: it is a set of vectors such that that set is endowed with vectorspace operators and properties. Thus {klesi} alone is insufficient. But the set underlying eigenspace $x_3$ is a type of {klesi}, with the property of being closed under linear transformation $x_2$ (up to scalar multiplication). The vector space and basis being used are not specified by this word. Use this word as a seltau in constructions such as \"eigenket\", \"eigenstate\", etc. (In such cases, {te} {aigne} is recommended for the typical English usages of such terms. Use {zei} in lujvo formed by these constructs. The term \"eigenvector\" may be rendered as {cmima} {be} {le} {te} {aigne}).

The space must be ordered or directed in some sense. Let the space X be the traditionally-ordered field of real numbers, and x and y be in X (or x be a geometric point which is represented in such manner and which belongs to a specified line/ray which has a defined positive direction and a specification of the meaning of the length of 1 unit); then, \"x bi'oi y\" represents the interval between x and x + y, where y is signed. In other words, this interval is like the body of the string in the scenario in which one of its endpoints is tacked down at x and the other is dragged out a distance y therefrom in the directions specified by the signum of y (with the string being pulled taut and being of length exactly y). Maintaining the same notation and continuing discussion of \"x bi'oi y\": if the clusivity for the first term (or 'on the left') is specified, then x is or is not included in the referenced interval as specified; if the clusivity for the second term (or 'on the right') is specified, then x + y is or is not included in the referenced interval as specified (note: this does not generally indicate whether y is included in the referenced interval). Units, particularly for y, must be explicit when appropriate. In a connected acyclic directed graph, x would be a node and y would be the graph-geodesic distance therefrom in the direction (if y is positive), or in the opposite direction (if y is negative), of the graph. This definition enables the ISO 8601 standard for time interval specification in the cases (1) of a starting time/pastward endpoint (namely x) and a duration (y: y > 0), and (2) of an ending time/futureward endpoint (namely x) and a duration (y: y < 0), where notation for \"x\" and \"y\" (in the usage \"x bi'oi y\") is continued from the earlier discussion in this note in the case of the number lines or the real; note that, in this usage case, x is a point in time (a timestamp) and y is a duration (elapsed time or measure of time, and which thus has explicitly specified units or something akin to the ISO 8601 standard notation for durations). See this proposal for more information on related topics: https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Proposal:_loi_lerfu_tcita_detri;_the_final_word_on_the_problem_of_dates_and_times%3F . Importantly, the ISO 8601 standard in the case of an ending time and a duration has the terms expressed in the order of y followed by x with y being positive; when this word is used for such purposes, y must be negative, but the order of x and y may be exchanged via usage of \"{se}\" (resulting in \"{sebi'oi}\"). Generally, the distinction between points/'positions' (represented by x) and measures/vectors/'displacements'/'translation vectors' (represented by y), in the sense of affine spaces, must be maintained when using this word. See also: \"{bi'o}\", \"{bi'i}\", \"{mi'i}\", \"{bi'oi'au}\", and https://mw-live.lojban.org/papri/Extended_Dimensionality_of_Interval_cmavo .","experimental cmavo",["affine space interval given by position and translation vector","ordered interval given by endpoint and signed measure","tack-and-drag ordered interval"],"","","BIhI"],["bi'oi'au","digit/number: interval/range indicator for significant digits (determined by lesser endpoint).","Given a well-formed digit string \"$x_{n} x_{n-1} ... x_{m}$ bi'oi'au $x_{m-1} x_{m-2} ...$\", where (a) \"$x_i$\" is a member of selma'o PA (other than this word or similar words; including at most one instance of \"{pi}\") for all $i$, and (b) the string represents$^{*_{1}}$ a finite number in base-$b$ (with $b$ taken to be ten by cultural convention in most human cases unless explicitly specified otherwise), the usage of this word in the aforementioned digit string yields an output of the interval $[\\sum_{i = 0}^{\\infty}{(x_{n-i} b^{n-i})}, \\, b^{m} + \\sum_{i = 0}^{\\infty}{(x_{n-i} b^{n-i})})$, after adjusting for \"$x_k$\" in the original string being \"{pi}\" or \"{pi'e}\" vel sim. for at least one $k$ (because that does not work in the summation notation without adjustment); notice the placement of the comma in the interval and clusivity of the endpoints thereof (lesser endpoint is included, but the greater one is excluded). Therefore, using/under the aforementioned notation and assumptions and specifications, usage of this word in \"$x_{n} x_{n-1} ... x_{m}$ bi'oi'au $x_{m-1} x_{m-2} ...$\" outputs an interval which is equivalent to the evaluation of/interval referenced by \"eval(\"$x_{n} x_{n-1} ... x_{m} x_{m-1} x_{m-2} ...$\") {ga'o} {bi'oi} {ke'i} $b^{m}$\". Importantly, usage of this word generates an interval, not a specific number (even if such would be elliptical or vague) - meaning, among other things, that equality to such an expression would be set equality, and not numeric equality. Note that the interval which is generated includes the lesser (left) endpoint (which is the number specified by the string with this word ignored in/removed from it) but excludes the greater (right) endpoint (which is the same number plus some integer power of the base $b$). As an example, where \"B\" represents this word: \"2B000\" yields [2000, 3000); meanwhile, \"20B00\" yields [2000, 2100); also, \"10.2B7\" yields [10.27, 10.37). This word/function is useful for dates (example: \"the 2000s\"), ages (example: \"they are in their twenties\"), or any estimate wherein the significant digits are known. Note that, for example, this functionality supports simple calendrical centuries (example: \"1900 to 2000, exclusive of the latter only\"), canonical calendrical centuries (example: \"1901 to 2001, exclusive of the latter only\"), and complicated century-long time intervals (example: \"1969 to 2069, exclusive of the latter only\"); and analogy applies, of course. The interval which is generated is a complete (math jargon) subset of the real numbers - there are no gaps and, in particular, the interval is not discrete (for example: it is not restricted to only the integers). Note that this word does not yield an interval of an arbitrary length; use \"{bi'oi}\", \"{bi'i}\", or \"{bi'o}\" for that. Use a construct similar to \"there exists a $t$ in (the interval) {re} bi'oi'au {mu} such that their age is measured to be (approximately) $t$ in years\" in order to express \"they are in their twenties (at least 20 years old and less than 30 years old)\"; the full English expression is wordy, but Lojban can make it concise in translation. See also: \"{bi'oi}\", \"{mi'i'au}\", \"{su'ai}\".
