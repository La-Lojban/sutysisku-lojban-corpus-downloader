This means that the seltau may compound with any other seltau present in the current construct; in any case (regardless of the presence of other seltau), the exact semantic interpretation of the referrent/copy-pasted seltau or the tanru construct as a whole may vary from that from which the relevant seltau were copied. Subscript with an integer in order to specify how many sumti to count backward through: \"0\" indicates the present sumti, \"+1\" indicates the immediately previous sumti (this is the default or non-subscripted meaning), \"n\" (for positive integer n) indicates the nth last sumti, \"-1\" means the next sumti, etc. Since this word acts as a seltau, it will be picked up in an immediately subsequent usage of the same word if the first occurrence is in a sumti. This word must always be followed by an explicit tertau to which it applies. This word need not be used in only sumti. It copies every element of the relevant seltau; it cannot select any proper subsequence thereof. \"{si}\" deletes this word and, thus, at once all of the would-be pasted words forming the relevant seltau.

It is not implied that $x_{(n+1)}$ is the minimal proper superset of $x_n$ for any integer $n>1$ (even if they are indeed a proper-superset/proper-subset pair); for example, $x_2$ may be a street number, $x_2$ may be a city, and $x_3$ may be a state, even though wards may subdivide cities (but contain street subsegments) and counties may subdivide states (and contain cities). Each subsequent sumti contains or possesses the previous one(s), except the first, as a node or location (or subunit) and is only slightly larger/broader than it/them. There is no fixed meaning to any given slot; they just collectively possess this 'zooming-out' property. For example: In \"Cupboard under the stairs, 4, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey, England, UK, northern hemisphere, Earth\", each term separated by commas would be its own separate sumti (and we could continue to widen the scope beyond Earth); note that \"4\" is a name and identifies a house. Postal codes or ZIP codes should be used with caution in this word - they must be inserted in the correct spot; for example, (in the U.S.) a standard ZIP code identifies (approximately) the administering post office or municipal region and, therefore, must come after a street name but usually before the city name; ZIP+4 usually identifies a subdivision of the city or service area for the local post office, so it would come after the street name but before the city name and the standard ZIP code; ZIP+4+2 is usually enough to identify a building, so it would precede the street name (but may follow the apartment number in some cases); going the other way: the first few digits identify the region of the country or type of high-level administrative subunit of the U.S. and would come somewhere after the state name or similar. Containment is not assumed to be proper, so consecutive sumti may be equivalent (for example ZIP+4+2 can be equivalent to the house/building identifier and street address, but may be strictly contain the apartment identifier). Delete $x_1$ in order to talk of things like \"Chesterfield, New Hampshire\" (tcaudu$_2$ = Chesterfield, tcaudu$_3$ = New Hampshire); in this case, since the terbri structure of this word (after tcaudu$_1$) is constant/symmetric wrt shift in sumti slot (indexing), it may be cleanest and most elegant to begin the bridi with the selbri. Any number of consecutive unfilled sumti slots (after tcaudu$_1$) is technically equivalent but may be used informally in order to show that the utterer has a well-defined or standard sequence of nested classes which subdivide the subsequent sumti and which contain the previous ones. Deleting any finite number of sumti slots after the first has no nontrivial effect. This word might be generalizable to other nested structures or graphs such as information in a file (example: cell coordinates, tab name, Excel file name, directory to which the file directly belongs, next superdirectory thereof, ..., stem directory) or members in a family tree (example: full name of person, branch of family, larger family name, ..., all of humanity, ..., all of Earth life).

This word can be used to specify the concept of \"$n$th cousin $m$-times removed\"-ness; $x_1$ and $x_2$ would be the cousins, $x_3-1 = n$, and $x_4$ is closely related to $m$ but is signed. If one views the tree graphs to which $x_1$ and $x_2$ belong with the viewing perspective such that siblings and spouses are mutually separated horizontally and such that ancestors are separated from their descendants vertically (with ancestors in the positive direction relative to their descendants), then $x_3$ is the unsigned horizontal distance between $x_1$ and $x_2$. Additionally, $x_4$ is, approximately, the signed generational offset/difference between subjects $x_1$ and $x_2$; it is their signed 'vertical' difference under the aforementioned viewing perspective and sign convention. The relationship need not actually be cousinhood  (as perceived by English); direct ancestor-descendant pairs, (aunt/uncle)-(niece/nephew) pairs, and in fact any pair of family members with a well-specified most recent common ancestor (that is known) have this relationship to one another. This word can be used for specifying the number of \"great\"'s in the title of a relationship between $x_1$ and $x_2$ (with some calculational forethought). The tree diagram can be more generic than a family tree though; thus cousinhood is just a way to put it into context/application and is not really essential to the meaning except through analogy. Notice the ordering of all terms; if the graph is directed, the arguments of the distance matters. The graph should probably be a tree locally if it is to be a well-defined relationship. $x_3$ is unchanged but $x_4$ is negated (multiplied by $-1$) by/under exchange of $x_1$ and $x_2$. The ordered pair $(x_3, x_4)$ is named \"consanguistance between $x_1$ and $x_2$ (in that order)\" by Curtis Franks. For a normal family tree and fixed $x_1$ therein, consanguistance produces countably many equivalence classes of nodes. It does not recognize the difference between half or full relatives, marriages/parentings are either unsupported (when $x_3 > 0$) or are reduced to be equivalent (when $x_3 = 0$ and $x_4 \\neq 0$), and gender/sex are ignored/reduced to equivalence. The set of nodes $x_2$ with $x_3 = 0$ is called $x_1$'s (the subject's) genealogical line (id est: if $x_3 = 0$, then $x_1$ re'au'e ja se dzena $x_2$ according to the edge relation on the graph or $x_1 = x_2$); the set of nodes with $x_3 > 0$ are sibling/branch/side lines, which could be labelled and ordered, but doing so would be somewhat difficult with this word. This word focuses on the relationship between $x_1$ and $x_2$, not the relationship between each of them and A; for that, see \".{anseingu}\". The underlying tree graph is, modulo an equivalence relation involving tseingu, a 'quipyew' tree graph (see \"{grafnkipliiu}\"). This concept is fairly unnatural and convoluted, so it is probably {malgli} except for the purpose of translations; in a natural, culturally-neutral Lojbanic context, \".anseingu\" is preferred.","fu'ivla",["consanguinity values","consanguistance","cousin degree","cousin order","cousin removal","degree of removal","kinship number"],"","",["tseingu"]],["tsekane","$x_1$ (linear manifold, vector, etc.) is/lies secant to $x_2$ (object, surface, curve, manifold, etc.) passing through or toward points/loci $x_3$ (set of intersected points), by standard/definition/in system $x_4$.","No necessary implication of co-directionality.

The entry for this cmavo compound is essentially a proposal to redefine the {va'i} spectrum slightly, to make it a little more like the similar discursive {ta'u}. Consider the English sentences: (A) \"Gold has atomic number 79, in other words, there are 79 protons in a gold nucleus.\" (B) \"There are 79 protons in a gold nucleus, in other words, gold has atomic number 79.\" In English, in both A and B, the parts are discursively connected by the same \"in other words\" connective, even though the connection is in two mutually opposite directions. To understand that there really is a difference between the two, consider another pair of sentences: (A') \"According to the Bible, God made the world in six days, in other words, it took almost a week to make everything around us.\" (B') \"According to the Bible, it took almost a week to make everything around us, in other words, God made the world in six days.\" Unlike A and B, from among the pair A' and B', only A' makes sense, B' sounds absurd. The proposal is to redefine Lojban's {va'i} and {va'i} {nai}, in the motivation to give {va'i} {nai} more of a use, to reflect this very Lojbanic difference in direction, which English cannot capture. This compound, i.e. \"va'i cu'i\" would then acquire the meaning of \"in the same words\". There is no set in stone rule for which of {va'i} and {va'i} {nai} stands for which direction for any given two pair of sentences: however, if one of them is used to connect them in one way, then the other one would connect them in the reverse order. \"broda .i va'i nai brode\" simply is defined as equivalent to \"brode .i va'i broda\".

This happens on structure c, which defines what various values and limits mean. b is the 'order' of the result of this convergence (so that it is the bth-order integral (equivalently, -bth-order derivative) of the Heaviside step/Theta function with respect to a so that b = -1 yields the Dirac delta 'function' centered/with interesting point at 0, b = 0 yields the Heaviside step/Theta function with respect to a centered at/with interesting point 0, etc.).  Natural numbers (or 0) for b yield a 'special' polynomial (let us call it p) of that order in indeterminant a for all values of a greater than 0 and 0 for all values of a less than 0 so that p(a) = a^b Theta(a). Input e is for when the particular functions in d are of interest and only e of them have been computed (so that, for finite e, the output is not exactly the bth order Heaviside function); in other words, the limit of the family indices is being taken to e; this is of particular importance for negative values of b: |b| > 1, since they will not be identically 0 in some sense (else, all information is lost about the special structure/nature of this function). The contextless defaults are: b = 0, c is the field of real numbers (with absolute value norm and ordering due to signed absolute value), d is bth-order integral of ((1 + y + z * erf(k a / (2^(1/2)) ) ) / 2)-like functions that are properly normalized and are of proper height, e is infinity (countable). Heaviside(0,0,...,f_0) = 1/2 = f_0 is typical and is a contextless default for b = 0 (however, it may in particular be set to 0 or 1 so that the function is left-/right-continuous at a = 0; for values of b other than 0, f_b = 0 is the contextless default; note that f_(-1) must be infinity 'of the proper magnitude' (it cannot be specified to be otherwise).

If a language lacks a minimal pair which distinguishes paired phonés, then any strings which nominally differ in only such pairs will belong to $x_2$ of this word in that language; in other words allophonic but not phonemic differences produce such similarities. But even with minimal pairs, some words may not be distinguishable. This word refers to indistinguishability in the form of a word as well as its meaning/usage; so, homophones are not necessarily similar in this sense, nor are synonyms. The combination of both qualities does produce such similarities in spoken English (not necessarily written English, since the orthography is not phonemic). In English, phonation duration and, in some cases, certain phonation qualities (such as tonation, voicing, nasalation, place of articulation, aspiration, etc. (again: only in some cases)) do not distinguish words. Dialectal differences usually produce such similarities too (a U.S. English speaker and a UK English speaker will say the word \"car\" differently but will agree about everything concerning it, including its rhyming qualities in their dialects, its meaning, and its spelling). In Lojban, phonation duration (such as \".{yyy} \" versus merely \".{y} \"; but notice that some transcriptions are interpreted as producing multiphthongs/glides/syllabification, so \".{iii} \" is distinct from mere \".{i} \") and minor differences in place of articulation (trilled \"r\" versus English \"r\", for example) and sometimes voicing (for nasals, rhotics, laterals, and presently xy) do not produce word distinctions; so, they will generate such similarities in Lojban.

In decimal, $10^{(1/2)} = \\sqrt{(10)} = 3.16227766\\dots$ (also expressed/represented in decimal). In different bases, this value may change; for example, in hexadecimal, it might be exactly four ($4$); however, this is an outstanding as-of-yet unsolidified area in the Lojban grammar/semantics (do \"{ki'o}\" and Metric prefixes change according to the base?). This number is nice, as it is close to both 3 and and the circle constant pi ($\\pi$) in decimal usage; these three values arise fairly frequently and a great trick in decimal Fermi estimation is to use their approximate identity in order to simplify expressions. Now, when the quantity is dimensionful (has units), if the mantissa approximates this value, then one can instead express the mantissa as approximately 1 and the unit as being augmented by this prefix. This word is also good for short-hand/quick expressions. This word has no English equivalent and is not part of the official set of SI prefixes, but it does generalize them. \"{xaudbo}\" = \"{kamre} {li} {dau} {te'a} {fi'u} {re}\" in decimal (if it generalizes for other bases, change \"dau\" into the base; in other words, \"dau\" generally becomes \"pano\" in such case, where the base is given by context). While this suggestion is not perfectly compatible with SI (which allows only one prefix at a time), the negative-power version of this (\"kamre li dau te'a {ni'u} fi'u re\", where \"dau\" has the aforementioned caveats; $1*10^{-(1/2)}$) can just be expressed as a lujvo/rafsi/tanru containing both \"{decti}\" and this word (as veljvo/selrafsi/{seljavytertau}), because $A^{(-1/2)} = \\sqrt{(1/A)} = A^{(+1/2)} / A$, and $A$ (ten in at least decimal) is the base.

If this word is followed by a number of/evaluated to a value 0 or 1 (preceded immediately by \"li\"), this value is taken to be an explicit reset of the mode to the value indicated (the value in question is called a seed value). Iff the seed value is 1, the mode is set thereinafter to multiplicative style; iff the seed value is 0, the mode is set thereinafter to additive style. (That is: the seed values represent the identity elements under the operation which the mode emulates.).  No other value, numerical or otherwise (including other sumti or even Boolean values, which actually mean \"truth\" and \"false\", rather than \"1\" and \"0\" respectively, despite common representations), may act as a seed value of this word.  Thus, only in the context of this word being followed by a \"li\"-introduced mekso expression X which evaluates to the numbers 0 or 1 wherein X is not intended to be taken as a seed value of this word must this word be followed by {ku} prior to X; in this case there is no explicit seed value. If this word has no explicit seed value, then this word causes the mode of interpretation of double-negatives to switch between multiplicative style and additive style; an utterance of this word switches the mode to whichever of these two options was not being used immediately previously.  Thus, it is its own terminator/negator.  Lojban default (without context) is in multiplicative mode: \"mi na na nelci\" is nearly equivalent to \"mi nelci\"; double-negatives cancel leaving a positive sense (even if it is not entirely/definitively affirmative). So, one utterance of this word (under standard conventions) in a given discourse will change double-negatives to become additive. This mode is similar to (some) Spanish negation or AAVE negation; multiple negatives compound/add together, intensifying the negativity (subjective truth-value) of an utterance.  In additive mode, \"[zau'e'u] mi na na nelci\" is equivalent to \"mi ba'e na nelci\" or something of the like; \"[zau'e'u] mi na na na na nelci\" would be simply further emphasized (roughly twice as emphatic as the previous example's negation).  This word is intended mostly for stylistic purposes and translations, as well as enabling further cultural neutrality. lai .krtisfranks. requests that this word (and all of its relevant information, including the selma'o label) be mapped to \"{zau'eu}\" if the string \"eu\" ever becomes officially accepted in Lojban.","experimental cmavo",["additive negation indicator","affirmation toggle","double-negative toggle","multiplicative negation indicator","negation mode toggle"],"","","","ZAUhEhU"],["zarziei","$x1$ pertains to Zarzian technological industry/culture/know-how of period and location (specifics) $x2$ in properties $x3$","","obsolete fu'ivla",["Zarzian"],"","",["zarziei"]],["za'u mai","discursive: further utterance ordinal","","cmavo-compound",["even","furthermore","moreover"],"","","","MAI*"],["za'u re'u","again; in addition to the first time; for the \"more\"-th time","See {krefu}, {rapli}","cmavo-compound",["again"],"","","","ROI*"],["zbabu","$x_{1}$ is a quantity of/contains/is made of soap from source $x_{2}$ of composition including $x_{3}$.","See also {lumci}, {fonmo}.","gismu",["soap"],"","",["bab","zbab","zbabu"]],["zbani","$x_{1}$ is a bay in/of coast/shoreline $x_{2}$.","See also {lalxu}, {xamsi}.","gismu",["bay"],"","",["zban","zbani"]],["zbasu","$x_{1}$ makes/assembles/builds/manufactures/creates $x_{2}$ out of materials/parts/components $x_{3}$.","Should not be used to express causation.

Given the other sumti in the predicate (filling the corresponding terbri), the underlying relation (selbri) is claimed to be invalid in this circumstance. Examples: \"non-integrable\", \"non-measurable\" (confer: \".{umre}\"), \"non-summable\" (say, of strings), \"the limit does not exist\". This avoids the necessity of creating a pair of words for every such mathematical concept (one for when the operation may be applied to the inputs so as to yield a well-defined value which may be specified and one for when such is not the case). Other uses may develop or be found. This word does not 'delete' the terbri (unlike \"{zi'o}\"); it simply says that the selbri is not really applicable. Whether or not the meaning of this word is within the generic semantic range of \"{zo'e}\" is debatable and not yet well-established. The conventions employed matter. The case of the product of zero and infinity usually must be handled by a separate definition (especially when dealing only with strictly real numbers); it is quite common to explicitly handle this case by defining the product as zero, but prior to such definition, \"lo pilji be li no bei li ci'i\" is meaningless and undefined (the symbols can be written but do not actually mean anything) - so, $pilji_1$ should be filled with this word in such a circumstance. As another example, unless the difference of infinity with infinity is defined (and following the convention that unconnected points have a graph distance of positive countable infinity), which is unnatural, the relationship represented by \"{tseingu}\" is undefined in its fourth terbri (so, it can be filled with this word) when its first and second sumti belong to mutually different trees (leaving their most recent mutually common ancestor undefined). Notice that the other terbri are well-defined in this circumstance - in particular, $tseingu_3$ is positive countable infinity; also notice that this word has a slightly less mathematical flavor (especially insofar as the first terbri is not result of applying a mathematical operation to the following terbri) than many other ready examples. Yet another example: In a zero-dimensional universe, $klama_4$ and possibly $klama_5$, as well as even more arguably $klama_2$, are undefined (and can be filled with this word), leaving the notion of 'going' empty and meaningless. In a $(-1)$-dimensional universe (an empty set), every terbri of \"{klama}\" (and probably every other word) is undefined and can be filled with this terbri.","experimental cmavo",["non-existent it","undefining it"],"","","","KOhA"],["zi'e'a","converts a following bu-letteral into a sumti representing the musical natural note with that name.","The next bu-letteral is absorbed and a natural accidental is given to it; e.g. \"zi'e'a gy\" means \"the note G-natural\".

For example, a two-year-old is older than a one-year-old but neither is old by normal human standards. This word indicates that not only is one of the referenced sumti more than another in some specified property, but at least one of them does have that property. So, an octagenarian is older than a toddler, and the former (but not the latter) actually is old by normal human standards. In my cases, if $x_4 = 2$, then not only does $x_2$ have property $x_3$, but $x_1$ also has property $x_3$ (just by a greater amount/to a greater extent); it is uncommon and indicative of a pathology in definition for $x_4 = 2$ to not imply that $x_4 = 1$ is also true. The converse is untrue: $x_1$ may have property $x_3$ even while $x_2$ does not ('$x_4 = 1$' is true but '$x_4 = 2$' is false, as in the octagenerian versus toddler example); however, in order to exclude the possibility that $x_4 = 2$ when $x_4 = 1$ is specified, one must explicitly specify that it is so - $x_4$ necessarily tells which argument does indeed satisfy the proposition of having property $x_3$, but it possibly may not necessarily give any information as to which argument does not do so.

A bound on a function is really a bound on the image (set; $x_2$) of the function's domain set under the operation of the function; otherwise, it is sumti-raising. $x_3$ accepts either a directional vector (normalized) / a point on the unit circle (in which case the direction from the origin to that point is the direction which is being considered), or exactly one of li {ma'u} and li {ni'u}; it is unlikely that any other input would be acceptable.  \"{ma'u}\" causes the bound to be an upper bound (a bound on the positive side or the 'right'/'above' when plotted using typical Western European conventions) - it is a number which exceeds/is greater than or equal to every element of $x_2$ in the set underlying $x_4$ according to the order endowing $x_4$. \"{ni'u}\" causes the bound to be an lower bound (a bound on the negative side or the 'left'/'below' when plotted using typical Western European conventions) - it is a number which is less than or equal to every element of $x_2$ in the set underlying $x_4$ according to the order endowing $x_4$. In order to be well-defined, all elements of $x_2$ united with the singleton of $x_1$ must be ordered according to the ordering endowing $x_4$; if $x_4$ lacks a good order, then $x_1$ is undefined. $x_4$ must be an ordered structure, not simply a set. Warning: If $x_3$ is explicitly filled, that is the only direction which is to be assumed.  If it is not explicitly filled, only one (or, arguably, possibly zero) direction(s) is(/are) to be assumed; in this context, it is to be inferred that the set $x_2$ is (possibly) bounded on at least one side/in at least one direction.  Connecting arguments by 'AND' in $x_3$ implies that $x_2$ is the set formed by the singleton of $x_3$; it is NOT the equivalent to the English term \"bound(ed)\" without qualifiers/adjectives (for that meaning, use modulus/absolute value/norm on the input of $x_1$). The bound is not strict (proposal: use {praperi} for this sense), but must be true of all elements of $x_2$ in that direction ($x_3$); it is not necessarily the extremal/best finite bound on $x_2$. $x_1$ is typically finite; submitting any infinity for it is arguably bad form but would imply that no element of $x_2$ is infinite on the side determined by $x_3$ (where \"infinite\" has meaning determined also by $x_4$; again, for \"finite\", use modulus/absolute value/norm) - no other information (about its being bounded or unbounded) can be discerned (unless the sumti in $x_3$ and/or $x_4$ are incompatible). For explicit statement of unboundedness (in a more general sense, possibly including ill-definition of what \"boundedness\" even means in this context) in the direction determined by $x_3$, use {zi'au} as the sumti of $x_1$ (confer earlier note about compatibility of definition and ordering of $x_4$ with $x_2$). $x_4$ can be more exotic than simply the field of real numbers.","fu'ivla",["bounded set","lower bound","set of only finite elements","unbounded set","upper bound"],"","",["zmaumce"]],["zmrenda","$x_1$ is a snack, any time of the day or night, of ingredients/contents $x_2$, of type/variety $x_3$","Spanish \"merienda\"; Tagalog \"meryenda\"","fu'ivla","","","",["zmrenda"]],["zo'anjo","$x_1$ (linear manifold, vector, etc.) is/lies tangent to $x_2$ (object, surface, curve, manifold, etc.) at point/locus $x_3$, by standard/definition/in system $x_4$.","No necessary implication of co-directionality.

Note that this definition is in the passive voice in English. The 'step-parent'/'step-child' or even direct spousal or resultant 'in-law' relationships may in some sense be viewed as adoption via marriage. This definition is very broad, but a certain degree of integration is assumed or required (at least for certain purposes). Adoption can be by a community and the 'familial' relationship can be simply a somewhat interpersonally-distant communal one. Adoption need not be by an older or more senior person of a younger or more junior one. $x_4$ is most useful when it differs from $x_2$ (particularly if $x_2$ is an individual). Adoption does not presuppose that no relationship, or even similar relationship, existed prior to the adoption, although it would be odd to adopt someone into exactly the same relationship which they already had attained.

The giving of $x_2$ may be in exchange for something or to make a debt whole vel sim., or it might not be; thus, this word abstains from specifying the cause of such a 'giving'.

If $x_2$ is presented as an ordered list, the entries represent the 'coefficients' of the particular polynomial and are specified in the order such that the $i$th entry/term is the $(n-i+1)$th 'coefficient', for all positive integers $i$ which are less than or equal to $n+1$, where the ordering of 'coefficients' is determined by the exponent of the indeterminate associated therewith (when treated as a function); thus, the last entry is the constant term (when treated as a function), the penultimate term is the coefficient of the argument of $x_5$ (when treated as a function), and the first term is the coefficient of the argument of $x_5$ exponentiated by $n$ (which is the degree $x_3$ of the polynomial $x_1$); in other words, the $i$th entry of $x_2$ (where indexing of the ordered list starts at $1$) is the coefficient of $x^{(n-i+1)}$, where $x_5 = x$ is the indeterminate. \"{ze'ai'au}\" enables for reversal of $x_2$ so that the first-uttered term is the constant, the next-uttered term is the coefficient of the linear term, ..., and the last ((n+1)st) term is the coefficient of the most-significant term in the polynomial ($x^n$).

For example, some criminal statutes say things like \"if the defendant has four criminal history points, then...\", but they actually mean \"if the defendant has four or more criminal history points, then...\". Likewise, it is almost always a lie in Lojban to say \"I am $t$ years old\", because one is almost never exactly $t$ years old (this expression is usually the result of rounding down to the nearest integer or half-integer); one should actually say \"I am between $t$ years old and $t+1$ years old\" – but toggling the grammar with this word would more closely approximate the natlang phrase (although an eighty-year-old could still correctly say, perhaps with some philosophical correctness too, that they are six years old). An even number of uses of this word return the grammar back to numeric exactitude. The \"at least\" interpretation applies to rafsi as well: a car is a bicycle after this word has been used an odd number of times because \"bicycle\" would actually mean \"at-least-two-wheeler\". Again, this could have some applicability in law, such as when banning the usage of vehicles, for example. \"{su'e} will operate normally under this word (so, \"su'e {re}\" would mean \"at most 2\" and not \"at most at-least-2\"; meaning that 3 is definitely excluded from the realm of possible numbers), but \"su'o\" is converted so as to mean \"exactly\" (given that it is otherwise useless; in other words, the exactitudes of unmarked numhers and \"su'o\"-marked ones swap with one another). This word does not affect brivla or modals, unless the former involve numeric rafsi; in particular, \"{zmadu}\", \"{satci}\", \"{mau}\", and the like are not affected. This word affects non-integer numbers as well, as demonstrated by the time example; after this toggle, one could accurately say that Cleopatra died five hundred years ago (because she died ealier than that).

This color is a subset/element (depending on interpretation/usage) of the colors associated with light in the radio and microwave regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Speaker determines how close \"approximately twenty-one centimeters\" is to exactly twenty-one centimeters. Technically can only be used for the coloration of light that would arise from the hyperfine spin-flip transition of a hydrogen atom (without any neutrons) in which the proton-electron quantum spin configuration abruptly changes from parallel to antiparallel in the 1s groundstate.  But other isotopes and/or hydrogenic (id est: single-electron) atoms can be referenced by semantic broadening; note that in any case, this word always refers to the color of the light emitted from such an object. This is a color, not a description of the process, conditions under which the light of this color is emitted, etc., nor is it the light itself nor wavelength of the light.  However, this term probably will come up in all such descriptions.  For example, \"hyperfine spin-flip transition\" might be rendered {xipfne binxo}. Technically, any object that emits photons with wavelengths of approximately twenty-one centimeters will be of the color xipfne, regardless of why such emission is occurring (id est: it need not be due to hydrogen hyperfine, proton/electron spin-flip transitions).  Usage in such a case is perfectly acceptable.  However, in practice, such occasions/contexts will be rare (essentially completely absent except in theory) and the only common usage will be in the context of hydrogen hyperfine proton/electron spin-flip transitions (as in astronomy, chemistry, or quantum mechanics). This is an electromagnetic (id est: light, photon) color.  It is physical (being derived from the properties of the wavelength of the emitted and received photon(s)), but is interpreted by some instrument (such as a telescope/camera system, an animal's optical system, etc.).
