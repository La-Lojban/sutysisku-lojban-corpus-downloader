When the argument of $x_4$ is 1, the generalized eigenspace $x_3$ is simply a strict/simple/basic eigenspace; this is the typical (and probable cultural default) meaning of this word. $x_4$ will typically be restricted to integer values k > 0. $x_2$ should always be specified (at least implicitly by context), for an eigenvalue does not mean much without the linear transformation being known. However, since one usually knows the said linear transformation, and since the basic underlying relationship of this word is \"eigen-ness\", the eigenvalue is given the primary terbri ($x_1$). When filling $x_3$ and/or $x_4$, $x_2$ and $x_1$ (in that order of importance) should already be (at least contextually implicitly) specified. $x_3$ is the set of all eigenvectors of linear transformation $x_2$, endowed with all of the typical operations of the vector space at hand. The default includes the zero vector (else the $x_3$ eigenspace is not actually a vector space); normally in the context of mathematics, the zero vector is not considered to be an eigenvector, but by this definition it is included. Thus, a Lojban mathematician would consider the zero vector to be an (automatic) eigenvector of the given (in fact, any) linear transformation (particularly ones represented by a square matrix in a given basis). This is the logically most basic definition, but is contrary to typical mathematical culture. This word implies neither nondegeneracy nor degeneracy of eigenspace $x_3$. In other words there may or may not be more than one linearly independent vector in the eigenspace $x_3$ for a given eigenvalue $x_1$ of linear transformation $x_2$. $x_3$ is the unique generalized eigenspace of $x_2$ for given values of $x_1$ and $x_4$. $x_1$ is not necessarily the unique eigenvalue of linear transformation $x_2$, nor is its multiplicity necessarily 1 for the same. Beware when converting the terbri structure of this word. In fact, the set of all eigenvalues for a given linear transformation $x_2$ will include scalar zero (0); therefore, any linear transformation with a nontrivial set of eigenvalues will have at least two eigenvalues that may fill in terbri $x_1$ of this word. The 'eigenvalue' of zero for a proper/nice linear transformation will produce an 'eigenspace' that is equivalent to the entire vector space at hand. If $x_3$ is specified by a set of vectors, the span of that set should fully yield the entire eigenspace of the linear transformation $x_2$ associated with eigenvalue $x_1$, however the set may be redundant (linearly dependent); the zero vector is automatically included in any vector space. A multidimensional eigenspace (that is to say a vector space of eigenvectors with dimension strictly greater than 1) for fixed eigenvalue and linear transformation (and generalization exponent) is degenerate by definition. The algebraic multiplicity $x_5$ of the eigenvalue does not entail degeneracy (of eigenspace) if greater than 1; it is the integer number of occurrences of a given eigenvalue $x_1$ in the multiset of eigenvalues (spectrum) of the given linear transformation/square matrix $x_2$. In other words, the characteristic polynomial can be factored into linear polynomial primes (with root $x_1$) which are exponentiated to the power $x_5$ (the multiplicity; notably, not $x_4$). For $x_4$ > $x_5$, the eigenspace is trivial. $x_2$ may not be diagonalizable. The scalar zero (0) is a naturally permissible argument of $x_1$ (unlike some cultural mathematical definitions in English). Eigenspaces retain the operations and properties endowing the vectorspaces to which they belong (as subspaces). Thus, an eigenspace is more than a set of objects: it is a set of vectors such that that set is endowed with vectorspace operators and properties. Thus {klesi} alone is insufficient. But the set underlying eigenspace $x_3$ is a type of {klesi}, with the property of being closed under linear transformation $x_2$ (up to scalar multiplication). The vector space and basis being used are not specified by this word. Use this word as a seltau in constructions such as \"eigenket\", \"eigenstate\", etc. (In such cases, {te} {aigne} is recommended for the typical English usages of such terms. Use {zei} in lujvo formed by these constructs. The term \"eigenvector\" may be rendered as {cmima} {be} {le} {te} {aigne}).

Making Type 4 {fu'ivla} (or {zi'evla}), on the other hand, presents the challenge of knowing, out of hundreds of wordlike phonological patterns, which will parse as  single-morpheme words and which will not. (For example, the nonce word {kadvati} will parse but *{kazvati} will not; {fra'aso} will but *{fra'asoi} will not; {kadnazbakai} will but {kadnazbackai} is a actually a lujvo.) Making Type 3 fu'ivla is comparatively easy, but still requires knowing how to use hyphen phonemes right and, of course, how to not violate phonotactical rules when lojbanizing foreign words.

The construct as a whole syntactically functions as a parenthetical so that mekso may be resumed immediately thereafter without any difficulty. This word attaches to/affects the immediately preceding macrodigit string extending from the last evaluated number, number operation, etc. or bracket to/until this word. The preceding number is semantically interpreted according to the description to which the following sumti refers. If a sequence is supplied as the following sumti, the preceding number is interpreted so that each digit, starting from the left (default: see next), is understood as a multiple of the corresponding value in the sequence under the ordering given (which may produce an invalid/ill-formed result; the placement of {pi} matters as well).  If a single number is submitted (such as \"li {dau}\"), this word acts as {ju'u}; the number is interpreted according to the rules of mekso and is its own island for such interpretation (thus {ju'u} is needed to override a cultural/grammatical default interpretation, such as decimal, even if this is done within the mekso expression outside of and including the scope of this word). In this way, the sumti being (10^n)_n, which is a sequence, is the same as the sumti being just 10, but is very different from it being the sequence (10)_n.  The original default for numeral-position/string reading/interpretation is from left-to-right, where a digit on the left in a pair of digits represents that multiple of a \"later\" term in the sequence as compared to right member of the pair; thus \"23\" in decimal means (2*(10^1)) + (3*(10^0)), which is twenty-three.  This default may be overridden via specification of the sequence (either its ordering, its domain being negated, or alteration to the base); alternatively, and perhaps more easily, the appearance of \"la'e zoi jbo. ri'u bi'o zu'a .jbo\" will always reverse it (this is a special input value with interpretation defined by this grammar); when reversed, \"23\" in decimal means (2*(10^0)) + (3*(10^1)), which is to say thirty-two.

The ith term in tuple X2 is replaced with the ith term in tuple X3; the replacements are executed simultaneously (thus, no overlap/contradiction can be allowed to arise in the substitution- in particular, in X2)  - alternatively, if there is overlap/conflict in/between the terms of X2, the replacements are performed in order of presentation (the ith term in X2 is replaced by the ith term in X3, and then the (i+1)th term in X2 is replaced with the (i+1)th term in X3, starting with the 1st term in each). X2 and X3 must have the same length/number of terms - alternatively, X3 cannot be longer/have more terms than X2; in this situation, the ith term of X2 is replaced with the ith term of X3 until and including when the last term of X3 is reached, after which point the remaining terms in X2 are not replaced at all. Use a permutation acting on X2 as the argument for X3 in order to rearrange the substrings of X1; if the alphabet is ordered, then operators can be applied to the letters in order to rotate through the alphabet. In particular, if X1 is a binary string (a word over an alphabet of two letters) and X2 is the 2-tuple of the letters of that binary alphabet (length-1 substrings), then without specification of X3, this operator defaults to bitwise binary negation (bit conjugation) wherein each letter in X1 is replaced by the unique other letter in the binary alphabet (otherwise, the replacement would be the identity/trivial replacement or just a formal substitution letter-by-letter which does not really change the nature of the word). X1 and each entry in X2 and X3 should be quoted, match a necessary type (such as being a character), or be abstracted a level by symbolics. In general, the replacement is formal and the strings in X3 need not be over the same alphabet as the one over which X1 is written. This operator is useful for combinatorial lines and for expanding digits (such as, in a binary string, replacing each occurrence of \"0\" with \"01\" and each occurrence of \"1\" with \"10\"; note that the replacement is instantaneous and simultaneous for all terms of X2 and every occurrence of such terms in X1, thus this substitution is perfectly acceptable).","experimental cmavo",["bit conjugation","bitwise binary negation","combinatorial line","digit expansion","find-and-replace"],"","","VUhU"],["bai'i'i","mekso operator: in ordered tuple/list/vector/sequence $X_1$, replace the $X_2$th entry with term $X_3$ of appropriate type, and leave all other entries untouched (optional: where the index for the very first/leading/header entry is $X_4$).","$X_1$ must be some ordered and indexed structure; $X_2$ must be an index which specifies an entry/element/term which actually appears in $X_1$; $X_3$ is an alternative value of appropriate type which can, and after this operation does, replace the $X_2$th entry/element/term; the counting for indices is according to explicitly specified or implicit cultural convention, or the natural convention for the circumstance, or (when ambiguous or unclear) starts with 1, unless $X_4$ specifies otherwise (in which case, it is according to that specification).

Example: bai'i'i((A, B, C, D, E, F, G), Set(5, 2), (b, e), 1) = (A, b, C, D, e, F, G), where the ordering on $X_2$ and $X_3$ is the standard ordering starting with 1; note that Set(5, 2) is unordered and that the standard ordering rearranges it as (2, 5) with 2 being the 1st entry/element, meaning that the index 2 (corresponding with B in $X_1$) gets linked with the first entry of $X_3$, which is b, meaning that B gets replaced by b in $X_1$.","experimental cmavo",["find-and-replace"],"","","VUhU"],["alminiu","$x_1$ is a quantity of/contains/is made of aluminium.","Cf. {jinme}.","obsolete fu'ivla",["aluminium"],"",["alminiu"]],["bangrlietuva","$x_1$ is the Lithuanian language used by $x_2$.","","obsolete fu'ivla","","",["bangrlietuva"]],["bangrnaidjiria","$x_1$ is the Nigerian English language used by $x_2$ to express/communicate $x_3$ (si'o/du'u, not quote).","Cf. {glibau}, {bangenugu}.","obsolete fu'ivla",["Nigerian English"],"",["bangrnaidjiria"]],["bangrtalia","$x_1$ is the Italian language used by $x_2$ to express/communicate $x_3$ (si'o/du'u, not quote).","Cf. {italian}, {bangu}, {bangitu'a}.","obsolete fu'ivla",["Italian"],"",["bangrtalia"]],["bangrturkie","$x_1$ is the Turkish language used by $x_2$ to express/communicate $x_3$ (si'o/du'u, not quote).","Cf. {kulnrturkie}, {kulnrturko}, {tu'urki}.","obsolete fu'ivla",["Turkish"],"",["bangrturkie"]],["bangrvietnama","$x_1$ is the Vietnamese language used by $x_2$ to express/communicate $x_3$ (si'o/du'u, not quote).","Cf. {xazdo}, {bangu}.","obsolete fu'ivla",["Vietnamese"],"",["bangrvietnama"]],["ba'ucu'i","discursive: \n{ba'u} - exaggeration\n{ba'ucu'i} - accuracy\n{ba'unai} - understatement.","","cmavo-compound",["accuracy"],"","","UI*3"],["ba'unai","discursive: \n{ba'u} - exaggeration\n{ba'ucu'i} - accuracy\n{ba'unai} - understatement.","","cmavo-compound",["understatement"],"","","UI*3"],["baurgusuve","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''gsw'' (Swiss German).","Cf. {dotybau}, {bandu'e'u}.","fu'ivla",["German","Swiss German"],"",["baurgusuve"]],["baurnu'a'u","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''nau'' (Nauru, Nauruan).","See also {bangu}","fu'ivla",["Nauru"],"",["baurnu'a'u"]],["baurzese","$x_1$ reflects Zese culture/language in aspect $x_2$.","See also {bangu}.","fu'ivla",["Zese"],"",["baurzese"]],["bardoz","bardo (Tibetan), an intermediate, transitional, or liminal state between death and rebirth","","cmevla"],["bau'u","preposition: outside of ...","See {bartu}, {ne'i}","experimental cmavo",["outside"],"","","FAhA"],["bino","number/quantity: 80 [eighty].","","cmavo-compound",["80"],"","","PA*"],["binono","number/quantity: 800 [eight hundred].","","cmavo-compound",["800"],"","","PA*"],["binonovo","number/quantity: 8004, without comma.","","cmavo-compound",["8004"],"","","PA*"],["binpre","$j_1$=$p_1$ is a middleman/mediator/contact/go-between/intercessor between parties $j_2$.","","lujvo",["contact","go-between","intercessor","mediator","middleman"],["jbini","prenu"]],["binrydi'a","$j_1$ is an insurance premium providing coverage against peril $j_2$=$b_3$ for insured $j_3$=$b_2$ (person), offered by insurer $j_4$=$b_1$.","","lujvo",["insurance premium"],["binra","jdima"]],["binryve'u","$v_1$ sells insurance $v_2$=$b_1$ to client $v_3$=$b_2$ for cost $v_4$, insurance against peril $b_3$ (event) providing benefit(s) $b_4$ (event).","","lujvo",["insurance agent","insurance broker","insurance salesman"],["binra","vecnu"]],["birjai","$x_1$=$j_1$ grasps/holds/hugs $x_2$=$j_2$ with $x_1$'s arms, at locus $x_3$=$j_4$.","See also {pamjai}.","lujvo",["hug, embrace"],["birka","jgari"]],["birjanke'a","$x_1$ is an armpit of $x_2$","","lujvo",["armpit"],["birka","janco","kevna"]],["birjinskami","$s1$ is an arm-ring computer for purpose $s2$; s1 is a smartwatch.","","lujvo",["smartwatch"],["birka","djine","skami"]],["birjyzba","$x_1$ brews alcoholic beverage $x_2$ from ingredients $x_3$","","lujvo",["brew"],["birje","zbasu"]],["birke'a","$x_1$ is an armpit of $x_2$.","","lujvo",["armpit"],["birka","kevna"]],["birtu'u","$t_1$ is a sleeve of material $t_2$ for the arm of $b_2$.","Cf. {birtafpau}, {birtu'ucau}.","lujvo",["sleeve"],["birka","tubnu"]],["birtu'ucaucreka","$cl_1$=$cr_1$ is a sleeveless shirt made of material $cr_2$.","See also {birtu'ucau} and {creka}","lujvo",["sleeveless shirt"],["birka","tubnu","claxu","creka"]],["bisko'u","$x_1$ is an cone of frozen $x_2$ (quantity) with vertex $x_3$ ; $x_1$ is an $x_2$-cicle","Possibly includes stalactites/stalagmites (possibly include {kunra} and/or {pulce} in the description).

The space must be ordered or directed in some sense. Let the space X be the traditionally-ordered field of real numbers, and x and y be in X (or x be a geometric point which is represented in such manner and which belongs to a specified line/ray which has a defined positive direction and a specification of the meaning of the length of 1 unit); then, \"x bi'oi y\" represents the interval between x and x + y, where y is signed. In other words, this interval is like the body of the string in the scenario in which one of its endpoints is tacked down at x and the other is dragged out a distance y therefrom in the directions specified by the signum of y (with the string being pulled taut and being of length exactly y). Maintaining the same notation and continuing discussion of \"x bi'oi y\": if the clusivity for the first term (or 'on the left') is specified, then x is or is not included in the referenced interval as specified; if the clusivity for the second term (or 'on the right') is specified, then x + y is or is not included in the referenced interval as specified (note: this does not generally indicate whether y is included in the referenced interval). Units, particularly for y, must be explicit when appropriate. In a connected acyclic directed graph, x would be a node and y would be the graph-geodesic distance therefrom in the direction (if y is positive), or in the opposite direction (if y is negative), of the graph. This definition enables the ISO 8601 standard for time interval specification in the cases (1) of a starting time/pastward endpoint (namely x) and a duration (y: y > 0), and (2) of an ending time/futureward endpoint (namely x) and a duration (y: y < 0), where notation for \"x\" and \"y\" (in the usage \"x bi'oi y\") is continued from the earlier discussion in this note in the case of the number lines or the real; note that, in this usage case, x is a point in time (a timestamp) and y is a duration (elapsed time or measure of time, and which thus has explicitly specified units or something akin to the ISO 8601 standard notation for durations). See this proposal for more information on related topics: https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Proposal:_loi_lerfu_tcita_detri;_the_final_word_on_the_problem_of_dates_and_times%3F . Importantly, the ISO 8601 standard in the case of an ending time and a duration has the terms expressed in the order of y followed by x with y being positive; when this word is used for such purposes, y must be negative, but the order of x and y may be exchanged via usage of \"{se}\" (resulting in \"{sebi'oi}\"). Generally, the distinction between points/'positions' (represented by x) and measures/vectors/'displacements'/'translation vectors' (represented by y), in the sense of affine spaces, must be maintained when using this word. See also: \"{bi'o}\", \"{bi'i}\", \"{mi'i}\", \"{bi'oi'au}\", and https://mw-live.lojban.org/papri/Extended_Dimensionality_of_Interval_cmavo .","experimental cmavo",["affine space interval given by position and translation vector","ordered interval given by endpoint and signed measure","tack-and-drag ordered interval"],"","","BIhI"],["bi'oi'au","digit/number: interval/range indicator for significant digits (determined by lesser endpoint).","Given a well-formed digit string \"$x_{n} x_{n-1} ... x_{m}$ bi'oi'au $x_{m-1} x_{m-2} ...$\", where (a) \"$x_i$\" is a member of selma'o PA (other than this word or similar words; including at most one instance of \"{pi}\") for all $i$, and (b) the string represents$^{*_{1}}$ a finite number in base-$b$ (with $b$ taken to be ten by cultural convention in most human cases unless explicitly specified otherwise), the usage of this word in the aforementioned digit string yields an output of the interval $[\\sum_{i = 0}^{\\infty}{(x_{n-i} b^{n-i})}, \\, b^{m} + \\sum_{i = 0}^{\\infty}{(x_{n-i} b^{n-i})})$, after adjusting for \"$x_k$\" in the original string being \"{pi}\" or \"{pi'e}\" vel sim. for at least one $k$ (because that does not work in the summation notation without adjustment); notice the placement of the comma in the interval and clusivity of the endpoints thereof (lesser endpoint is included, but the greater one is excluded). Therefore, using/under the aforementioned notation and assumptions and specifications, usage of this word in \"$x_{n} x_{n-1} ... x_{m}$ bi'oi'au $x_{m-1} x_{m-2} ...$\" outputs an interval which is equivalent to the evaluation of/interval referenced by \"eval(\"$x_{n} x_{n-1} ... x_{m} x_{m-1} x_{m-2} ...$\") {ga'o} {bi'oi} {ke'i} $b^{m}$\". Importantly, usage of this word generates an interval, not a specific number (even if such would be elliptical or vague) - meaning, among other things, that equality to such an expression would be set equality, and not numeric equality. Note that the interval which is generated includes the lesser (left) endpoint (which is the number specified by the string with this word ignored in/removed from it) but excludes the greater (right) endpoint (which is the same number plus some integer power of the base $b$). As an example, where \"B\" represents this word: \"2B000\" yields [2000, 3000); meanwhile, \"20B00\" yields [2000, 2100); also, \"10.2B7\" yields [10.27, 10.37). This word/function is useful for dates (example: \"the 2000s\"), ages (example: \"they are in their twenties\"), or any estimate wherein the significant digits are known. Note that, for example, this functionality supports simple calendrical centuries (example: \"1900 to 2000, exclusive of the latter only\"), canonical calendrical centuries (example: \"1901 to 2001, exclusive of the latter only\"), and complicated century-long time intervals (example: \"1969 to 2069, exclusive of the latter only\"); and analogy applies, of course. The interval which is generated is a complete (math jargon) subset of the real numbers - there are no gaps and, in particular, the interval is not discrete (for example: it is not restricted to only the integers). Note that this word does not yield an interval of an arbitrary length; use \"{bi'oi}\", \"{bi'i}\", or \"{bi'o}\" for that. Use a construct similar to \"there exists a $t$ in (the interval) {re} bi'oi'au {mu} such that their age is measured to be (approximately) $t$ in years\" in order to express \"they are in their twenties (at least 20 years old and less than 30 years old)\"; the full English expression is wordy, but Lojban can make it concise in translation.

(Footnote #1: this entire commentary section assumes that the method of interpretation is via a big-endian, traditional, unbalanced, positional, base-$b$ numerical-representation system with $b$ being an integer such that $b > 1$; however, the method of interpretation can be extended to other systems, such as $p$-adics or such as balanced integer or complex base-$b$ systems, in natural and fairly self-evident ways, although no endeavor shall be made herein in order to do so and the assumptions about $b$ and the method of interpretation should be as aforementioned, ignoring such possibilities for extension).","experimental cmavo",["interval-from-number determined by lesser endpoint"],"","","PA"],["biorka","$x_1$ is a birch of species $x_2$","See {tricu}.
