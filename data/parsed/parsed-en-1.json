For example, \"li pa ce'o li re\" means \"big-endian\" (the most significant term (represented by \"li pa\") comes first in the sequence and the sequence has exactly two terms), \"li re ce'o li pa\" means \"little-endian\" ((the most significant term (represented by \"li pa\") comes last in the sequence and the sequence has exactly two terms), \"li re ce'o li ci ce'o le pa\" is middle-endian (as in the conventional representation of dates in the U.S. (MM-DD-YYYY); the second most signifant term (represented by \"li re\"; example: month) comes first, the least significant term (represented by \"li ci\"; example: day) comes second, and the most significant term (represented by \"li pa\"; example: year) comes last, and there are exactly three terms), \"li pa ce'o li ci ce'o li re\" is the reverse of the last (example: YYYY-DD-MM). The point is that, while it is cumbersome, this method of filling $x_2$ is generalizable and explicit. \"Bi-endian\" (traditional sense) can be specified by a judicious usage of the word \".{a}\" between the little-endian and big-endian sequences; less conventional endiannesses which could be described as being \"bi-endian\" or even \"$n$-endian\" can be formed by different or more elaborate connectives between such sequences; just worry about grouping of connectives.

Presumably objects that have the same symbol as A but different B and C values are mutual(ly) related/analogs, but are at least formally distinguishable. B and C each default to 1. In practice, tick marks are usually called prime marks (and probably will effectively/culturally have a value of C=1); other distinguishing features are employed usually once these are used, such as overbars, over-tildes/over-twiddles, dagger, asterisks, etc. For a fixed C, this operator forms a series in B for each A. The meaning is context-specific. B = 0 iff C = 0; if A in unprimed (lacks any distinguishing marks), then B = 0; thus all mathematical objects have this operator implicitly attached to them with the value of 0 for the second and third argumentsize (note that this is not the default value for these arguments when this operator is explicitly mentioned).

Thus, the indices/labels specified are included in the range of sampling; id est: if the matrix entries listed belong to the ith row and jth column and the (i+n)th row and (j+m)th column respectively (for positive integers i,j,n,m), then the sampling will be conducted in all rows of number between (and including) i and i+n (yielding n+1 sampled rows) and in all columns of number between (and including) j and j+m (yielding m+1 sampled columns). The default diagonal sampling procedure for x4 is as follows: The first sampled entry has the minimum allowed (as specified in x3) indices.  All latter sampled entries (by default) have indices of the immediately previous sampled entry each augmented by 1. (Which is to say that if the kth sampled entry has indices (x,y,...), in that order, then the (k+1)th sampled entry has indices (x+1,y+1,...), in that order and where each subsequent index would be the respective index of the kth sampled entry augmented by 1).  The process terminates generally whenever exactly one entry is sampled from each of the rows, each of the columns, etc. of the tensor.  In the default, the process terminates when at least one of the indices of a sampled entry of the tensor is as large as possible in the range specified by x3. Thus, in order to reconcile the general and the default termination conditions, the range specified by x3 must be compatible with both; id est: it must be a r-dimensional hypercube of entries, so to speak, where r is the rank of tensor x2. The default for sampling range x3 is between and including the entry in the first row and first column (etc.) and the entry in the last row and last column (etc.) for an r-dimensional hypercube tensor (meaning that each row, column, etc. of the tensor has exactly the same number of entries as the others).  Generally, the default range begins with the entry of indices each minimal in the tensor (called 'the first entry') and extends to include (\"draw\") the maximal r-dimensional hypercube of entries in the tensor with one vertex on the first entry; in other words, if the minimum of the set of maximal indices in the tensor is g, then the sampling range is every row between the first and the gth, every column between the first and the gth, etc.  Generally, the sampling range must be an r-dimensional orthotope of some positive size (that is to say: including at least one entry) no larger than the tensor itself, but with the freedom to place at most r of its vertices among the entries thereof; if the default sampling procedure x4 is being used, then the r-dimensional orthotope must be an r-dimensional hypercube. Generalizes to any tensor, but is only interesting for tensors of rank at least 1.

Make sure to convert $x_3$ from an operator to a sumti; $x_3$ is the 'f' in \"f-mean\" and must be a complex-valued, single-valued function which is defined and continuous on $x_2$ and which is injective; it defaults to the $p$th-power function ($z^p$) for some nonzero $p$ (note that it need not be positive or an integer) and indeterminate/variable/input $z$, or $log$, or $exp$ (as functions); culture or context can further constrain the default.

The default of $x_4$ is the ordered set of $n$ terms with each term equal identically to $1/n$, where the cardinality of $x_2$ is $n$.

This should typically not refer to the mean of a function ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_of_a_function ), although it generalizes easily; alternatively, with appropriate weighting, allow $x_2$ to be the image (set) of the function whose average is desired over the entire relevant subset of its domain - notice that the weights will have to themselves be functions of the data or the domain of the function; in this context, the function is not necessarily $x_3$.

Note that this definition is in the passive voice in English. The 'step-parent'/'step-child' or even direct spousal or resultant 'in-law' relationships may in some sense be viewed as adoption via marriage. This definition is very broad, but a certain degree of integration is assumed or required (at least for certain purposes). Adoption can be by a community and the 'familial' relationship can be simply a somewhat interpersonally-distant communal one. Adoption need not be by an older or more senior person of a younger or more junior one. $x_4$ is most useful when it differs from $x_2$ (particularly if $x_2$ is an individual). Adoption does not presuppose that no relationship, or even similar relationship, existed prior to the adoption, although it would be odd to adopt someone into exactly the same relationship which they already had attained.

It can pack such detail into short words and syllables due to its large phonemic inventory, use of phonemic tone and stress, and complex agglutinative morphology.

Making Type 4 {fu'ivla} (or {zi'evla}), on the other hand, presents the challenge of knowing, out of hundreds of wordlike phonological patterns, which will parse as  single-morpheme words and which will not. (For example, the nonce word {kadvati} will parse but *{kazvati} will not; {fra'aso} will but *{fra'asoi} will not; {kadnazbakai} will but {kadnazbackai} is a actually a lujvo.) Making Type 3 fu'ivla is comparatively easy, but still requires knowing how to use hyphen phonemes right and, of course, how to not violate phonotactical rules when lojbanizing foreign words.

If $m$ is defined, then its contextless default value is $m = 0$. This function/word first determines the base being used for interpretation of digit strings (determined by context or by explicit specification (JUhAU)) for/as applied to $x$; this determination takes place even before inputs are accepted after $x$; let this base be represented by $b$ throughout this description unless $b$ is explicitly specified as an input. In such case, if the base of $x$ is a positional system wherein each digit represents a corresponding multiple of a fixed natural number raised to the power of its position (as determined relative to the radix point) and wherein the overall number is the sum of these results/representands, or if $b$ is explicitly specified as an input, then $t$ is defined; if the base of $x$ is sufficiently bad or unclear and $b$ is not explicitly specified as an input, then $t$ is undefined. Of course, if $b$ is explicitly specified as an input, then that value (if valid) is the meaning of \"$b$\" throughout this description. If $t$ is undefined, then its slot is automatically and implicitly deleted from this word in that context (so the operator is at-most-3-ary and its input acceptance is terminated by the '$n$' xor '$m$' slot, whichever one is later yet defined (because, assumptively, '$b$' is not explicitly specified); if '$m$' is defined and explicitly uttered when '$t$' is undefined and the '$x$' and '$n$' values have been explicitly specified, then the third input is '$m$') and \"$b^t$\" $=$ \"$b^{(-t)}$\" $= b = 1$ formally for the purposes of this definition (but not necessarily for the base for any digit-to-number interpretation/conversion, particularly on $x$!). If $t$ is defined, then its contextless default value is $t = 0$. The rounding function, determined by $n$, is performed on $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$. If $n = 1$, then the rounding function is the ceiling function: $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ is mapped to the least integer that is greater than or equal to it; in other words, it rounds up. If $n = -1$, then the rounding function is the floor function: $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ is mapped to the greatest integer that is less than or equal to it; in other words, it rounds down. These integers are both determined by the ordering and metric. If $n = 0$, then the rounding function maps $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ to the integer that minimizes the metric distance between itself and $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ if a unique such integer exists (id est: $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ is mapped to the nearest integer, where \"nearest\"-ness is determined according to the order and metric); if no such unique integer exists, then $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ is mapped to the unique integer among these aforementioned options for which there exists an integer $Z$ such that $2Z+m$ is the integer in question; if no unique such integer exists, then the function is undefined. Thus, $n = 0$ produces the commonly used unbiased nearest-integer rounding function. In each of these cases, the output of the rounding function is then multiplied by sgn$(x) b^{t}$. Thus, it rounds at the $t$th digit if $b$ matches the base of $x$ and else to the nearest multiple of $b$ in the $t$th digit of abs$(x)$, so to speak. Notice that rounding up or down always is applied to the absolute value, so it is really rounding (positive or negative) infinity-ward or zeroward respectively. The order on, and the operators and metric endowing, the metric space and field of all real numbers is determined by context or by explicit specification. The absolute value function is denoted as \"abs( )\" in the definition, and the signum function sgn is such that sgn$(z) = z/$abs$(z)$ for all real $z:$ abs$(z) > 0$, and sgn$(0) = 0$.",["ceiling function","floor function","nearest integer function","round down","rounding function","round to nearest integer","round up"],"","VUhU"],["ji'i'u'u","mekso, at-most-5-ary; rounding function.

In other words, where \"ji'i'u\" really rounds toward or away from $0$, this word rounds toward negative or positive infinity. The behaviors coincide for nonnegative $x$, but differ for $x < 0$; for example, for $x < 0$, a 'negative-type' rounding for \"ji'i'u\" would round toward $0$, which is actually an increase in value (just decrease in absolute value) while remaining negative, whereas a 'negative-type' rounding here would round toward negative infinity, which is a decrease in value (but an increase in absolute value) while remaining negative.

The construct as a whole syntactically functions as a parenthetical so that mekso may be resumed immediately thereafter without any difficulty. This word attaches to/affects the immediately preceding macrodigit string extending from the last evaluated number, number operation, etc. or bracket to/until this word. The preceding number is semantically interpreted according to the description to which the following sumti refers. If a sequence is supplied as the following sumti, the preceding number is interpreted so that each digit, starting from the left (default: see next), is understood as a multiple of the corresponding value in the sequence under the ordering given (which may produce an invalid/ill-formed result; the placement of {pi} matters as well).  If a single number is submitted (such as \"li {dau}\"), this word acts as {ju'u}; the number is interpreted according to the rules of mekso and is its own island for such interpretation (thus {ju'u} is needed to override a cultural/grammatical default interpretation, such as decimal, even if this is done within the mekso expression outside of and including the scope of this word). In this way, the sumti being (10^n)_n, which is a sequence, is the same as the sumti being just 10, but is very different from it being the sequence (10)_n.  The original default for numeral-position/string reading/interpretation is from left-to-right, where a digit on the left in a pair of digits represents that multiple of a \"later\" term in the sequence as compared to right member of the pair; thus \"23\" in decimal means (2*(10^1)) + (3*(10^0)), which is twenty-three.  This default may be overridden via specification of the sequence (either its ordering, its domain being negated, or alteration to the base); alternatively, and perhaps more easily, the appearance of \"la'e zoi jbo. ri'u bi'o zu'a .jbo\" will always reverse it (this is a special input value with interpretation defined by this grammar); when reversed, \"23\" in decimal means (2*(10^0)) + (3*(10^1)), which is to say thirty-two.  Generally, this word overrides the default interpretation of a string of microdigits when computing the value of a macrodigit (see: {ju'u'i}).

In order to overcome this limitation, iteration can be used (else, this definition may need to be modified). The result must be defined (and finite, obviously).

If unary (meaning that $X_1$ is not explicitly specified in a hypothetical expression \"${X_1}\\setminus{X_2}$\"), then $X_1$ is taken to be some universal set $O$ in/of the discourse (of which all other mentioned or relevantly formable sets are subsets, at the least); in this latter case, the word operates as the set (absolute) complement of the explicitly mentioned set here designated as $X_2$ for clarity (id est: the output is $O\\setminus{X_2}={X_2}^{C}$, where \"$^{C}$\" denotes the set absolute complement; in other words, it is the set of all elements which may be under consideration such that they are not elements of the explicitly specified set). When binary with both $X_1$ and $X_2$ explicitly specified, this word/operator is the set relative complement. This word is somewhat analogous to, depending on its arity, logical 'NOT' or 'AND NOT' (just as set intersection is analogous to logical 'AND', set union is analogous to logical '(AND/)OR'  and set symmetric difference is analogous to 'XOR').
