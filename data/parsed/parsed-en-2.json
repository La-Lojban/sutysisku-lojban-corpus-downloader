Technically, $x_1$ (therefore, also $x_2$) and $x_3$ are mutually so, as well. However, $x_3$ will typically be used in order to identify the 'side of the family tree/genealogy' being considered and $x_2$ will typically be the focal point at which the several sides of family trees (including the considered one) intersect (being otherwise disjoint); as such, $x_2$'s paternal uncle will not be described as being $x_2$'s father's brother on $x_2$'s side of the tree. In other words, there is a large family tree with at least two 'sides' and they intersect at exactly one node; this node of intersection is canonically to typically be $x_2$ and $x_3$ is canonically to typically be used to designate which of these possible sides is being considered such that $x_1$ belongs to it. (Symmetry is enabled by the fact that the only inferrable family tree is the 'side' produced; the larger family tree is unknown, and so the collection of potential sides amongst which the specification is taken is also unknown). The largest family tree (graph union of all sides of the mentioned relatives) is the graph which the utterer and/or relatives mentioned consider to be the entirety of the family of all the relatives mentioned (plus some near relatives, so long as they belong to exactly one side); thus, it may include marriages, god-children, close friends, and exes, but it is unlikely to span over many generations. For example, maternal and paternal sides of families are considered to be separate sides of the family tree for a child, even if in the distant unknown past, that father and that mother share some sort of familial relationship (even including a biological common ancestor). This word can be used to hint at a path in the graph from $x_1$ to $x_2$, since there exists a path which connects them and which also includes $x_3$; therefore, it can be used to vaguely mean \"my onclic aunt-in-law by my Uncle John\" meaning that the referent is the utterer's Uncle John's wife's sister (or sister in law); use connectives in $x_3$ in order to include (if the connective means \"AND\") more nodes which must have paths (not necessarily the same ones) running through them from $x_1$ to $x_2$. This word does not actually specify any of the relations between $x_1$, $x_2$, or $x_3$ arguments; it merely claims that they are all related and belong to a common (effective) family tree.

Note that this definition is in the passive voice in English. The 'step-parent'/'step-child' or even direct spousal or resultant 'in-law' relationships may in some sense be viewed as adoption via marriage. This definition is very broad, but a certain degree of integration is assumed or required (at least for certain purposes).

By default, the macrodigit is interpreted as being written/expressed in some cultural or grammatical default (this default is overridden by {ju'au} if its specifying sumti requires an alternative interpretation for the value of the macrodigits), probably decimal- the interpretation of the string of microdigits produces a number, x; the \"{pi'e}\" implies the denominator to be used in determining the fraction for which x is in the numerator and context or possibly a specified base determines its value- in timekeeping, the interpretation is typically x/60 for certain macrodigits. However, the default for determining the value of x given a string of microdigits might be useful to override (for example, Tsohnai uses an overall factorial base but each macrodigit is written in balanced quinary); this word specifies the base used for interpreting the macrodigit from a string of microdigits. It is placed at the end of the string (possibly before the next \"{pi'e}\") and its scope of effect extends from there, through the string of microdigits, to either the beginning of the number as a whole or the most recent \"{pi'e}\" (whichsoever was more recently uttered). It is to be followed by a sumti (or multiple sumti strung together by connectives) and has its scope of specification terminate with that sumti; in this regard, it works syntactically and semantically exactly like {ju'au}. In fact, {ju'au} can be used outside of the number in order to specify the macrodigit interpretation instead of this word (for example, if its sumti were la .tsonais., this word would not be needed); however, if only a sequence were to have been given as the argument of {ju'au} (such as the factorial sequence) and if some base other than decimal were desired for the interpretation of each macrodigit from the string of microdigits, then this word would be used. If only one macrodigit appears in the number, then this word is equivalent to {ju'au}. In short, the scope of this word is one contiguous string of microdigits, and it influences their interpretation into a macrodigit value in the same way that {ju'au} does. However, if both {ju'au} and this word specify how to interpret a given string of microdigits in the same number (composed of macrodigits), this word overrides the interpretation specified by {ju'au} (but only for this macrodigit); thus, for example, a Tsohnai number can have each of its macrodigits be interpreted in balanced quinary except one, which the speaker specifies via this word, because they know the value but did not want to convert it to balanced quinary (because it may be too large or hard to do so easily), so they instead expressed it in decimal.","experimental cmavo",["long-digit interpretation specifier","macrodigit named base specifier"],"","","JUhUhI"],["ka'ai","{kansa} modal, 1 place; with .../with a companion ...","See also {kansa}","experimental cmavo",["with"],"","","BAI"],["ka'au","mekso unary operator: cardinality (#, | |)","Usually should be reserved for use on sets; if applied to group, it is the cardinality of the underlying set (Which is the order of the group)- but it should probably not be applied to an element of a group.

This is the standard operation for negation in Spanish. \"Multiplicative negation\" means that negatives cancel, but do not intensify, one another (possibly taking a neutral or abstentional state). \"I did not see nothing\" in this mode means that the speaker did indeed see something. Note that multiplicative double-negatives are not necessarily equivalent to affirmatives in general. \"I like cheese\" is an affirmative statement and is not equivalent to \"I do not dislike cheese\", which is a multiplicative double-negative (and which may indicate a reluctant acceptance of cheese or a neutral feeling toward cheese).

This word also, but less dramatically, applies to affirmations: in additive mode, multiple affirmatives intensify one another (\"I am indeed very much so going!\" is a strongly emphasized positive statement); in multiplicative mode, they simply reduce to a single affirmation (for like example, \"I am going\"). This means that care must be taken: In additive mode, an affirmative marker will partially cancel with a negative particle in some way, reducing its intensity and possibly bringing it to a neutral statement (\"I am indeed - not - going\" is a neutral statement in this mode, similar to \"I may be going\"; English does not really have the ability to express such things); in multiplicative mode, an affirmative coupled with a negative simply reduces to the negative, possibly strengthened by a factor equivalent to the intensity of the affirmer (\"I am indeed not going\" is a clear way of saying that the speaker will not go).","experimental cmavo",["double-negative mode toggle"],"","","NEIhAI"],["nei'au","unary mekso operator: $(-1)^x$","Macro for exponentiating -1 by the input, which is an extremely common term.
