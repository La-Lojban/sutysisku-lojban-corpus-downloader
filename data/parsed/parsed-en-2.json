For example, \"li pa ce'o li re\" means \"big-endian\" (the most significant term (represented by \"li pa\") comes first in the sequence and the sequence has exactly two terms), \"li re ce'o li pa\" means \"little-endian\" ((the most significant term (represented by \"li pa\") comes last in the sequence and the sequence has exactly two terms), \"li re ce'o li ci ce'o le pa\" is middle-endian (as in the conventional representation of dates in the U.S. (MM-DD-YYYY); the second most signifant term (represented by \"li re\"; example: month) comes first, the least significant term (represented by \"li ci\"; example: day) comes second, and the most significant term (represented by \"li pa\"; example: year) comes last, and there are exactly three terms), \"li pa ce'o li ci ce'o li re\" is the reverse of the last (example: YYYY-DD-MM). The point is that, while it is cumbersome, this method of filling $x_2$ is generalizable and explicit. \"Bi-endian\" (traditional sense) can be specified by a judicious usage of the word \".{a}\" between the little-endian and big-endian sequences; less conventional endiannesses which could be described as being \"bi-endian\" or even \"$n$-endian\" can be formed by different or more elaborate connectives between such sequences; just worry about grouping of connectives.

For example, for matrix A=((1, 2), (3, 4)), A+(fau'a)10 = ((11, 12),(13, 14)) and A^2 = ((7, 10), (15, 22)); however, A^(fau'a)2 = ((1, 4), (9, 16)); likewise, sin(A) = A - (1/3)A^3 + (1/5)A^5 - ..., but sin(fau'a)(A) = ((sin(1), sin(2)), (sin(3), sin(4))), which is meant to show the distribution of the sin() function to each entry of A, although it also happens to be equivalent to applying the Taylor expansion to A via \"fau'a\" as well. Caution must be used: matrix addition or scalar multiplication of matrices already have this distributional property, so this word is not needed in those cases; in fact, A+(fau'a)A would yield ((1+A, 2+A), (3+A, 4+A)), which is nonsensical (because, without \"fau'a\", the addition of a scalar entry to a matrix is undefined).","experimental cmavo",["distribution of function to entries","entrywise function application"],"","","FAUhA"],["fa'u'ai","non-logical connective: antirespectively; unmixed but reverse ordered distributed association.","Works together with {fa'u}; given an ordering by {fa'u}, the terms connected by this word are (applied) in opposite order.","experimental cmavo",["and antirespectively","anti-respectively","antirespectively"],"","","JOI"],["fau'ai","Iteratively applies \"fau'a\" to each resultant operator until all operators resolve.","Let matrix A = ((1, 2), (3, 4)); then A +(fau'ai) A = A +({fau'a}*) A = ((1 +(fau'a*) A, 2 +(fau'a*) A), (3 +(fau'a*) A, 4 +(fau'a*) A)) = (( ((1+1, 1+2), (1+3, 1+4)), ((2+1, 2+2),(2+3, 2+4)) ), ( ((3+1, 3+2), (3+3, 3+4)), ((4+1, 4+2), (4+3, 4+4)) )), which has all of the additions resolve (so the iteration terminates) - the result is a 2-by-2 matrix in which each entry is itself a 2-by-2 matrix.

Thus, in order to reconcile the general and the default termination conditions, the range specified by x3 must be compatible with both; id est: it must be a r-dimensional hypercube of entries, so to speak, where r is the rank of tensor x2. The default for sampling range x3 is between and including the entry in the first row and first column (etc.) and the entry in the last row and last column (etc.) for an r-dimensional hypercube tensor (meaning that each row, column, etc. of the tensor has exactly the same number of entries as the others).  Generally, the default range begins with the entry of indices each minimal in the tensor (called 'the first entry') and extends to include (\"draw\") the maximal r-dimensional hypercube of entries in the tensor with one vertex on the first entry; in other words, if the minimum of the set of maximal indices in the tensor is g, then the sampling range is every row between the first and the gth, every column between the first and the gth, etc.  Generally, the sampling range must be an r-dimensional orthotope of some positive size (that is to say: including at least one entry) no larger than the tensor itself, but with the freedom to place at most r of its vertices among the entries thereof; if the default sampling procedure x4 is being used, then the r-dimensional orthotope must be an r-dimensional hypercube. Generalizes to any tensor, but is only interesting for tensors of rank at least 1. Any mention of geometric terminology (such as mention of diagonals, orthotopes, etc.) in the definition or notes of this word should be interpreted cautiously and is not necessarily good Lojbanic practice; such terminology should not necessarily be emulated in practicing Lojbanic thought or speech.

Make sure to convert $x_3$ from an operator to a sumti; $x_3$ is the 'f' in \"f-mean\" and must be a complex-valued, single-valued function which is defined and continuous on $x_2$ and which is injective; it defaults to the $p$th-power function ($z^p$) for some nonzero $p$ (note that it need not be positive or an integer) and indeterminate/variable/input $z$, or $log$, or $exp$ (as functions); culture or context can further constrain the default.

The default of $x_4$ is the ordered set of $n$ terms with each term equal identically to $1/n$, where the cardinality of $x_2$ is $n$.

Note that if the weights are all $1$ and $x_2$ is set equal to not the $p$th-power function, but instead the $p$th-power function left-composed with the absolute value function (or the forward difference function), then the result is the $p$-norm on $x_2$ scaled by $n^{(-1/p)}$ for integer $n$ being the cardinality of $x_2$. This should typically not refer to the mean of a function ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_of_a_function ), although it generalizes easily; alternatively, with appropriate weighting, allow $x_2$ to be the image (set) of the function whose average is desired over the entire relevant subset of its domain - notice that the weights will have to themselves be functions of the data or the domain of the function; in this context, the function is not necessarily $x_3$. If $x_3$ is a single extended-real number $p$ (not a function), then this word refers to the weighted power-mean and it is equivalent to letting $x_2$ equal the $p$th-power function as before iff $p$ is nonzero real, the $max$ or $min$ as before if $p$ is infinite (according to its signum as before), and $log$ if $p$=$0$ (thus making the overall mean refer to the geometric mean); this overloading is for convenience of usage and will not cause confusion because constant functions are very much so not injective.","fu'ivla",["arithmetic mean","average","generalized f-mean","generalized mean","geometric mean","harmonic mean","log-sum-exponential","LSE","max","mean","mean value","min","norm","norm","p-norm","power mean","quasi-arithmetic mean","RMS","root-mean-square","typical"],"",["cnanfadi"]],["cnanlagau","$x_1$ is the generalized arithmetic-geometric mean of the elements of the 2-element set $x_2$ (set; cardinality must be 2) of order $x_3$ (either single extended-real number xor an unordered pair/2-element set of extended-real numbers).","Elements of $x_2$ must have the same units/dimensionality; the result has the same units/dimensionality as them.

Note that this definition is in the passive voice in English. The 'step-parent'/'step-child' or even direct spousal or resultant 'in-law' relationships may in some sense be viewed as adoption via marriage. This definition is very broad, but a certain degree of integration is assumed or required (at least for certain purposes).

Adoption need not be by an older or more senior person of a younger or more junior one. $x_4$ is most useful when it differs from $x_2$ (particularly if $x_2$ is an individual). Adoption does not presuppose that no relationship, or even similar relationship, existed prior to the adoption, although it would be odd to adopt someone into exactly the same relationship which they already had attained.

This word must be followed by a sumti; for the purpose of this explanation, this sumti will be xy (as in \"de'ai xy\").  The affected terbri is defined to default to the value xy (the sumti as a whole, including gadri, tanru, relative clauses, etc.); in other words, when not explicitly filled or when filled be {di'au}, the sumti value filling the affected terbri is that of xy.  This affect remains in effect until the end of the text/conversation or until/unless the default setting of this terbri explicitly redefined (overriding by {di'ei} is temporary/only applies to that usage). If xy is {zo'e}, the default value is completely general and elliptical; thus, permanently overriding a default setting on a specific terbri may be done by \"de'ai zo'e\".

Moreover, therefore, the default value defined by this word does not immediately/necessarily affect the truth value of the statement in which it appears (it only does so if the second following sumti is not {di'au}, implicit (or possibly) explicit {zo'e}, or xy itself); however, in all future uses of the brivla to which the terbri belongs, unless explicitly filled with a sumti of a different value, the truth value of those statements will be affected.
