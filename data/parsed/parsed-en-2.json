For example, \"li pa ce'o li re\" means \"big-endian\" (the most significant term (represented by \"li pa\") comes first in the sequence and the sequence has exactly two terms), \"li re ce'o li pa\" means \"little-endian\" ((the most significant term (represented by \"li pa\") comes last in the sequence and the sequence has exactly two terms), \"li re ce'o li ci ce'o le pa\" is middle-endian (as in the conventional representation of dates in the U.S. (MM-DD-YYYY); the second most signifant term (represented by \"li re\"; example: month) comes first, the least significant term (represented by \"li ci\"; example: day) comes second, and the most significant term (represented by \"li pa\"; example: year) comes last, and there are exactly three terms), \"li pa ce'o li ci ce'o li re\" is the reverse of the last (example: YYYY-DD-MM). The point is that, while it is cumbersome, this method of filling $x_2$ is generalizable and explicit. \"Bi-endian\" (traditional sense) can be specified by a judicious usage of the word \".{a}\" between the little-endian and big-endian sequences; less conventional endiannesses which could be described as being \"bi-endian\" or even \"$n$-endian\" can be formed by different or more elaborate connectives between such sequences; just worry about grouping of connectives.

If $X_2 = 0$, then the prime factors with nonzero power are counted without multiplicity (they are counted only uniquely and according to their distinctness, ignoring their exponents unless such is $0$ (in which case, it is not counted)); in other words, under this condition, this word would function as the number-theoretic prime little-omega function LittleOmega$(x_1) =$ Sum$_{p|X_1} (1)$, where: the summation is taken over all $p$, such that all of the bound $p$ must be prime, and \"$|$\" denotes divisibility of the term on the right (second term) by the term on the left (first term).

Unary: $X_{2} ^{C}$; binary: ${X_1}\\setminus{X_2}$.","Each input must be a set or similar. The definition of the binary case expands to \"the set of exactly those elements which are in $X_1$ but not in $X_2$\". This word and operator has ordered input: '$X_1$ kei'i $X_2$' is not generally equivalent to '$X_2$ kei'i $X_1$'; in other words, the operator is not commutative. If unary (meaning that $X_1$ is not explicitly specified in a hypothetical expression \"${X_1}\\setminus{X_2}$\"), then $X_1$ is taken to be some universal set $O$ in/of the discourse (of which all other mentioned or relevantly formable sets are subsets, at the least); in this latter case, the word operates as the set (absolute) complement of the explicitly mentioned set here designated as $X_2$ for clarity (id est: the output is $O\\setminus{X_2}={X_2}^{C}$, where \"$^{C}$\" denotes the set absolute complement; in other words, it is the set of all elements which may be under consideration such that they are not elements of the explicitly specified set). When binary with both $X_1$ and $X_2$ explicitly specified, this word/operator is the set relative complement. This word is somewhat analogous to, depending on its arity, logical 'NOT' or 'AND NOT' (just as set intersection is analogous to logical 'AND', set union is analogous to logical '(AND/)OR'  and set symmetric difference is analogous to 'XOR'). The preferred description/name in English is \"set (theoretic) exclusion\". See also: \"{kleivmu}\".

This is the standard operation for negation in Spanish. \"Multiplicative negation\" means that negatives cancel, but do not intensify, one another (possibly taking a neutral or abstentional state). \"I did not see nothing\" in this mode means that the speaker did indeed see something. Note that multiplicative double-negatives are not necessarily equivalent to affirmatives in general. \"I like cheese\" is an affirmative statement and is not equivalent to \"I do not dislike cheese\", which is a multiplicative double-negative (and which may indicate a reluctant acceptance of cheese or a neutral feeling toward cheese). In this mode, an even number of negatives in a given statement is not negative and an odd number of negatives in a given statement is not positive. This word applies to all negatives in the text, whether they are free words or rafsi. This word also, but less dramatically, applies to affirmations: in additive mode, multiple affirmatives intensify one another (\"I am indeed very much so going!\" is a strongly emphasized positive statement); in multiplicative mode, they simply reduce to a single affirmation (for like example, \"I am going\"). This means that care must be taken: In additive mode, an affirmative marker will partially cancel with a negative particle in some way, reducing its intensity and possibly bringing it to a neutral statement (\"I am indeed - not - going\" is a neutral statement in this mode, similar to \"I may be going\"; English does not really have the ability to express such things); in multiplicative mode, an affirmative coupled with a negative simply reduces to the negative, possibly strengthened by a factor equivalent to the intensity of the affirmer (\"I am indeed not going\" is a clear way of saying that the speaker will not go).","experimental cmavo",["double-negative mode toggle"],"","","NEIhAI"],["nei'au","unary mekso operator: $(-1)^x$","Macro for exponentiating -1 by the input, which is an extremely common term.

The number of polytope 'tiles' used can be specified in the third of fifth terbri as desired; the polytopes used need not all be the same, nor regular, so long as the arrangement is meaningful and possible. One of the main differences between rectangular polyplets and polyominoes is that polyominoes cannot have their polytope tiles touching only at their vertices whereas polyplets can (thus, polyominoes are a subset of the rectangular polyplets); this difference can be specified in the final terbri. A tiling of a space may be considered to be an infinite polyform, but that is rather pathological and we can reasonably assume that polyforms referenced by this word will be finite. The polyform is considered to be a unified whole entity. The ambient space is usually going to be the Euclidean space of the same dimension as the polytopes (and the former dimension cannot be exceeded by the latter except in the marginal case of lower-dimensional (id est: hyperplanar) arrangements, in which case parallel cross-sections are really being considered); this space determines the rigid-motion/symmetry isomorphisms of various polyforms (Z and S tetraminoes are non-isomorphic under rigid-motion in the Euclidean plane but are so isomorphic in Euclidean 3-space). The ambient space also determines the expression of (and indeed the 'allowed') polytopes: spherical geometry allows for digons to be arranged so as to form a polyform, but Euclidean 2-space prohibits such objects from the set of possible polygons. The default polytope will probably be a 2-dimensional square; thus the default ambient space will likely be Euclidean 2-space.

This permutation is given by the cycle $(n, 1, 2, \\dots, n-2, n-1)$ acting on the indices of the terbri (notice that this is cyclic permutation notation, not an ordered tuple (as appears in the definition)). For a selbri with 2 sumti slots, this is equivalent to \"{se}\"; for one with 3 slots, it is \"{to'ai}\"; for 4, it is \"{vo'ai}\"; for 5, it is \"{xo'ai}\". See also: \"{se'au'e}\" for the inverse. The behavior of this word when applied to open-ended terbri structures (such as for \"{jutsi}\") is yet to be explored; use it cautiously in such contexts, or perhaps not at all.","experimental cmavo",["clockwise by 1 click conversion","shift rightward by 1 conversion"],"","","SE"],["se'anai","attitudinal modifier: \n{se'a} - self-sufficiency\n{se'anai} - dependency.","","cmavo-compound",["dependency"],"","","UI*5"],["se'au'e","$(2, 3, \\dots, n-1, n, 1)$st conversion.","Permutes the terbri so that the $m$th sumti slot of the new selbri is the $(m+1)$st sumti slot of the original selbri, for any natural $m$ such that $1 \\leq m < n$, and the last (id est: $n$th) sumti slot of the new selbri is the first sumti slot of the original selbri, where the cardinality of the terbri of the original selbri (and thus the new one) is $n$ (such that $n$ is a natural number) each.
