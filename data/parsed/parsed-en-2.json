By default, the macrodigit is interpreted as being written/expressed in some cultural or grammatical default (this default is overridden by {ju'au} if its specifying sumti requires an alternative interpretation for the value of the macrodigits), probably decimal- the interpretation of the string of microdigits produces a number, x; the \"{pi'e}\" implies the denominator to be used in determining the fraction for which x is in the numerator and context or possibly a specified base determines its value- in timekeeping, the interpretation is typically x/60 for certain macrodigits. However, the default for determining the value of x given a string of microdigits might be useful to override (for example, Tsohnai uses an overall factorial base but each macrodigit is written in balanced quinary); this word specifies the base used for interpreting the macrodigit from a string of microdigits. It is placed at the end of the string (possibly before the next \"{pi'e}\") and its scope of effect extends from there, through the string of microdigits, to either the beginning of the number as a whole or the most recent \"{pi'e}\" (whichsoever was more recently uttered). It is to be followed by a sumti (or multiple sumti strung together by connectives) and has its scope of specification terminate with that sumti; in this regard, it works syntactically and semantically exactly like {ju'au}. In fact, {ju'au} can be used outside of the number in order to specify the macrodigit interpretation instead of this word (for example, if its sumti were la .tsonais., this word would not be needed); however, if only a sequence were to have been given as the argument of {ju'au} (such as the factorial sequence) and if some base other than decimal were desired for the interpretation of each macrodigit from the string of microdigits, then this word would be used. If only one macrodigit appears in the number, then this word is equivalent to {ju'au}. In short, the scope of this word is one contiguous string of microdigits, and it influences their interpretation into a macrodigit value in the same way that {ju'au} does. However, if both {ju'au} and this word specify how to interpret a given string of microdigits in the same number (composed of macrodigits), this word overrides the interpretation specified by {ju'au} (but only for this macrodigit); thus, for example, a Tsohnai number can have each of its macrodigits be interpreted in balanced quinary except one, which the speaker specifies via this word, because they know the value but did not want to convert it to balanced quinary (because it may be too large or hard to do so easily), so they instead expressed it in decimal.","experimental cmavo",["long-digit interpretation specifier","macrodigit named base specifier"],"","","JUhUhI"],["ka'ei","abstractor: predicate abstractor. $x_1$ is the predicate expressed by [bridi], using bo'a, bo'e, etc for variables.","Identical in meaning to an n-ary {ka}, but with lambda-variables bound to {bo'a}/{bo'e}/{bo'i}/{bo'o}/{bo'u} ({bo'ai} for additional variables) instead of {ce'u} (which may still be used for \"next place\").

Technically, $x_1$ (therefore, also $x_2$) and $x_3$ are mutually so, as well. However, $x_3$ will typically be used in order to identify the 'side of the family tree/genealogy' being considered and $x_2$ will typically be the focal point at which the several sides of family trees (including the considered one) intersect (being otherwise disjoint); as such, $x_2$'s paternal uncle will not be described as being $x_2$'s father's brother on $x_2$'s side of the tree. In other words, there is a large family tree with at least two 'sides' and they intersect at exactly one node; this node of intersection is canonically to typically be $x_2$ and $x_3$ is canonically to typically be used to designate which of these possible sides is being considered such that $x_1$ belongs to it. (Symmetry is enabled by the fact that the only inferrable family tree is the 'side' produced; the larger family tree is unknown, and so the collection of potential sides amongst which the specification is taken is also unknown). The largest family tree (graph union of all sides of the mentioned relatives) is the graph which the utterer and/or relatives mentioned consider to be the entirety of the family of all the relatives mentioned (plus some near relatives, so long as they belong to exactly one side); thus, it may include marriages, god-children, close friends, and exes, but it is unlikely to span over many generations. For example, maternal and paternal sides of families are considered to be separate sides of the family tree for a child, even if in the distant unknown past, that father and that mother share some sort of familial relationship (even including a biological common ancestor). This word can be used to hint at a path in the graph from $x_1$ to $x_2$, since there exists a path which connects them and which also includes $x_3$; therefore, it can be used to vaguely mean \"my onclic aunt-in-law by my Uncle John\" meaning that the referent is the utterer's Uncle John's wife's sister (or sister in law); use connectives in $x_3$ in order to include (if the connective means \"AND\") more nodes which must have paths (not necessarily the same ones) running through them from $x_1$ to $x_2$. This word does not actually specify any of the relations between $x_1$, $x_2$, or $x_3$ arguments; it merely claims that they are all related and belong to a common (effective) family tree.

Note that this definition is in the passive voice in English. The 'step-parent'/'step-child' or even direct spousal or resultant 'in-law' relationships may in some sense be viewed as adoption via marriage.

Adoption need not be by an older or more senior person of a younger or more junior one. $x_4$ is most useful when it differs from $x_2$ (particularly if $x_2$ is an individual).

The words may change, but so long as the exact same message (in every way, including connotation, formality, style of presentation, etc.) is maintained, then this word may be applied (in addition to \"{rau'o}\"); obviously, this works best when exactly quoting an utterance in the same language with extremely high confidence (such as after a recording). Use attitudinal intensity modifiers/negators in order to achieve the other valences. Does not imply completeness of the quote or, necessarily (although practically), maintenance of the original quotation's language; see \"{mu'o'u}\" and \"{rau'o}\" for these respectively.","experimental cmavo",["exact quote"],"","","RAUhO"],["re'ai'e","free conversion","Must be followed immediately by an ordered tuple (even if it is empty or 1-entry) of natural numbers which is immediately preceded by {li}; immediately after this tuple (which must be terminated), must be a brivla with at least as many terbri as the maximum of the length of the tuple (the number of entries which it possesses) and the greatest entry. The output of this entire construct is a selbri. The nth entry of the tuple, which is the natural number $a_n$, is the label number of the terbri in the official definition of the selbri which is the nth terbri in the selbri which is produced as a result of this word. So, for example, the tuple (3, 2, 4, 1) means that the first terbri of the new selbri is the third terbri of the selbri in this construct, the second terbri of the new selbri is the second terbri of the selbri in this construct (no change there), third terbri of the new selbri is the fourth terbri of the selbri in this construct, and fourth terbri of the new selbri is the first terbri of the selbri in this construct.
