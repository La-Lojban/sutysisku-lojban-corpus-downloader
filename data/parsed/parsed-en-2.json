Thus, the indices/labels specified are included in the range of sampling; id est: if the matrix entries listed belong to the ith row and jth column and the (i+n)th row and (j+m)th column respectively (for positive integers i,j,n,m), then the sampling will be conducted in all rows of number between (and including) i and i+n (yielding n+1 sampled rows) and in all columns of number between (and including) j and j+m (yielding m+1 sampled columns). The default diagonal sampling procedure for x4 is as follows: The first sampled entry has the minimum allowed (as specified in x3) indices.  All latter sampled entries (by default) have indices of the immediately previous sampled entry each augmented by 1. (Which is to say that if the kth sampled entry has indices (x,y,...), in that order, then the (k+1)th sampled entry has indices (x+1,y+1,...), in that order and where each subsequent index would be the respective index of the kth sampled entry augmented by 1).  The process terminates generally whenever exactly one entry is sampled from each of the rows, each of the columns, etc. of the tensor.  In the default, the process terminates when at least one of the indices of a sampled entry of the tensor is as large as possible in the range specified by x3. Thus, in order to reconcile the general and the default termination conditions, the range specified by x3 must be compatible with both; id est: it must be a r-dimensional hypercube of entries, so to speak, where r is the rank of tensor x2. The default for sampling range x3 is between and including the entry in the first row and first column (etc.) and the entry in the last row and last column (etc.) for an r-dimensional hypercube tensor (meaning that each row, column, etc. of the tensor has exactly the same number of entries as the others).  Generally, the default range begins with the entry of indices each minimal in the tensor (called 'the first entry') and extends to include (\"draw\") the maximal r-dimensional hypercube of entries in the tensor with one vertex on the first entry; in other words, if the minimum of the set of maximal indices in the tensor is g, then the sampling range is every row between the first and the gth, every column between the first and the gth, etc.  Generally, the sampling range must be an r-dimensional orthotope of some positive size (that is to say: including at least one entry) no larger than the tensor itself, but with the freedom to place at most r of its vertices among the entries thereof; if the default sampling procedure x4 is being used, then the r-dimensional orthotope must be an r-dimensional hypercube. Generalizes to any tensor, but is only interesting for tensors of rank at least 1. Any mention of geometric terminology (such as mention of diagonals, orthotopes, etc.) in the definition or notes of this word should be interpreted cautiously and is not necessarily good Lojbanic practice; such terminology should not necessarily be emulated in practicing Lojbanic thought or speech.

For example, \"li pa ce'o li re\" means \"big-endian\" (the most significant term (represented by \"li pa\") comes first in the sequence and the sequence has exactly two terms), \"li re ce'o li pa\" means \"little-endian\" ((the most significant term (represented by \"li pa\") comes last in the sequence and the sequence has exactly two terms), \"li re ce'o li ci ce'o le pa\" is middle-endian (as in the conventional representation of dates in the U.S. (MM-DD-YYYY); the second most signifant term (represented by \"li re\"; example: month) comes first, the least significant term (represented by \"li ci\"; example: day) comes second, and the most significant term (represented by \"li pa\"; example: year) comes last, and there are exactly three terms), \"li pa ce'o li ci ce'o li re\" is the reverse of the last (example: YYYY-DD-MM). The point is that, while it is cumbersome, this method of filling $x_2$ is generalizable and explicit. \"Bi-endian\" (traditional sense) can be specified by a judicious usage of the word \".{a}\" between the little-endian and big-endian sequences; less conventional endiannesses which could be described as being \"bi-endian\" or even \"$n$-endian\" can be formed by different or more elaborate connectives between such sequences; just worry about grouping of connectives.

If $x_2 = -1$ and $X_3$ is the typical ring of integers (with the ordering here being the traditional ordering of the integers), then the output is $k =$ sup$($Set$(i: i$ is a positive integer, and $v_{p_i}(X_1) > 0))$, where: $p_i$ is the $i$th prime (such that $p_1 = 2$), and $v_p$ is the $p$-adic valuation (see: \"{pau'au}\") of the input; in other words, this mode yields the index $i$ of the greatest prime $p_i$ which has a nonzero power $r_i$ such that $p_i^{r_i}$ divides $X_1$; if $X_1$ is a unit and $x_2 = -1$, then this word outputs $0$; if $X_1 = 0$ and $X_2 = -1$, then this word outputs positive infinity; this mode counts early primes which have power $0$ in the prime factorization of $X_1$ but does not count the infinitely many later ones which occur after the last nonzero prime power in that factorization (when $X_1$ is not $0$ and is not a unit). If $X_2 = 0$, then the prime factors with nonzero power are counted without multiplicity (they are counted only uniquely and according to their distinctness, ignoring their exponents unless such is $0$ (in which case, it is not counted)); in other words, under this condition, this word would function as the number-theoretic prime little-omega function LittleOmega$(x_1) =$ Sum$_{p|X_1} (1)$, where: the summation is taken over all $p$, such that all of the bound $p$ must be prime, and \"$|$\" denotes divisibility of the term on the right (second term) by the term on the left (first term).

This operator is intended to be maximally general; some definition for $X_3$ being the empty set can be devised, or '$a$' or $b$ could be function-valued or otherwise exotic-valued functions (so long as their outputs have sum, division, and closure properties), etc. See also: \"{se'au}\". If diphthong \"eu\" is ever accepted into Lojban, this definition would preferably be moved to \"{fi'eu}\" (because the \"eu\" would also be etymologically tied to \"Kettenbruch\", and the \"au\" diphthong is more basic and should be reserved for higher-priority words).","experimental cmavo",["continued fraction","Kettenbruch"]],["ju'u'i","long-digit interpretation specifier; macrodigit named base specifier","When a string of multiple digits is on either side of {pi'e}, the string is to be interpreted as a single \"macrodigit\" in the longer numeric string; let the digits that compose it be called \"microdigits\" for clarity. By default, the macrodigit is interpreted as being written/expressed in some cultural or grammatical default (this default is overridden by {ju'au} if its specifying sumti requires an alternative interpretation for the value of the macrodigits), probably decimal- the interpretation of the string of microdigits produces a number, x; the \"{pi'e}\" implies the denominator to be used in determining the fraction for which x is in the numerator and context or possibly a specified base determines its value- in timekeeping, the interpretation is typically x/60 for certain macrodigits. However, the default for determining the value of x given a string of microdigits might be useful to override (for example, Tsohnai uses an overall factorial base but each macrodigit is written in balanced quinary); this word specifies the base used for interpreting the macrodigit from a string of microdigits. It is placed at the end of the string (possibly before the next \"{pi'e}\") and its scope of effect extends from there, through the string of microdigits, to either the beginning of the number as a whole or the most recent \"{pi'e}\" (whichsoever was more recently uttered). It is to be followed by a sumti (or multiple sumti strung together by connectives) and has its scope of specification terminate with that sumti; in this regard, it works syntactically and semantically exactly like {ju'au}. In fact, {ju'au} can be used outside of the number in order to specify the macrodigit interpretation instead of this word (for example, if its sumti were la .tsonais., this word would not be needed); however, if only a sequence were to have been given as the argument of {ju'au} (such as the factorial sequence) and if some base other than decimal were desired for the interpretation of each macrodigit from the string of microdigits, then this word would be used. If only one macrodigit appears in the number, then this word is equivalent to {ju'au}. In short, the scope of this word is one contiguous string of microdigits, and it influences their interpretation into a macrodigit value in the same way that {ju'au} does. However, if both {ju'au} and this word specify how to interpret a given string of microdigits in the same number (composed of macrodigits), this word overrides the interpretation specified by {ju'au} (but only for this macrodigit); thus, for example, a Tsohnai number can have each of its macrodigits be interpreted in balanced quinary except one, which the speaker specifies via this word, because they know the value but did not want to convert it to balanced quinary (because it may be too large or hard to do so easily), so they instead expressed it in decimal.","experimental cmavo",["long-digit interpretation specifier","macrodigit named base specifier"],"","","JUhUhI"],["ka'ai","{kansa} modal, 1 place; with .../with a companion ...","See also {kansa}","experimental cmavo",["with"],"","","BAI"],["ka'au","mekso unary operator: cardinality (#, | |)","Usually should be reserved for use on sets; if applied to group, it is the cardinality of the underlying set (Which is the order of the group)- but it should probably not be applied to an element of a group.

If $m$ is defined, then its contextless default value is $m = 0$. This function/word first determines the base being used for interpretation of digit strings (determined by context or by explicit specification (JUhAU)) for/as applied to $x$; this determination takes place even before inputs are accepted after $x$; let this base be represented by $b$ throughout this description unless $b$ is explicitly specified as an input. In such case, if the base of $x$ is a positional system wherein each digit represents a corresponding multiple of a fixed natural number raised to the power of its position (as determined relative to the radix point) and wherein the overall number is the sum of these results/representands, or if $b$ is explicitly specified as an input, then $t$ is defined; if the base of $x$ is sufficiently bad or unclear and $b$ is not explicitly specified as an input, then $t$ is undefined. Of course, if $b$ is explicitly specified as an input, then that value (if valid) is the meaning of \"$b$\" throughout this description. If $t$ is undefined, then its slot is automatically and implicitly deleted from this word in that context (so the operator is at-most-3-ary and its input acceptance is terminated by the '$n$' xor '$m$' slot, whichever one is later yet defined (because, assumptively, '$b$' is not explicitly specified); if '$m$' is defined and explicitly uttered when '$t$' is undefined and the '$x$' and '$n$' values have been explicitly specified, then the third input is '$m$') and \"$b^t$\" $=$ \"$b^{(-t)}$\" $= b = 1$ formally for the purposes of this definition (but not necessarily for the base for any digit-to-number interpretation/conversion, particularly on $x$!). If $t$ is defined, then its contextless default value is $t = 0$. The rounding function, determined by $n$, is performed on $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$. If $n = 1$, then the rounding function is the ceiling function: $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ is mapped to the least integer that is greater than or equal to it; in other words, it rounds up. If $n = -1$, then the rounding function is the floor function: $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ is mapped to the greatest integer that is less than or equal to it; in other words, it rounds down. These integers are both determined by the ordering and metric. If $n = 0$, then the rounding function maps $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ to the integer that minimizes the metric distance between itself and $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ if a unique such integer exists (id est: $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ is mapped to the nearest integer, where \"nearest\"-ness is determined according to the order and metric); if no such unique integer exists, then $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ is mapped to the unique integer among these aforementioned options for which there exists an integer $Z$ such that $2Z+m$ is the integer in question; if no unique such integer exists, then the function is undefined. Thus, $n = 0$ produces the commonly used unbiased nearest-integer rounding function. In each of these cases, the output of the rounding function is then multiplied by sgn$(x) b^{t}$. Thus, it rounds at the $t$th digit if $b$ matches the base of $x$ and else to the nearest multiple of $b$ in the $t$th digit of abs$(x)$, so to speak. Notice that rounding up or down always is applied to the absolute value, so it is really rounding (positive or negative) infinity-ward or zeroward respectively. The order on, and the operators and metric endowing, the metric space and field of all real numbers is determined by context or by explicit specification. The absolute value function is denoted as \"abs( )\" in the definition, and the signum function sgn is such that sgn$(z) = z/$abs$(z)$ for all real $z:$ abs$(z) > 0$, and sgn$(0) = 0$.","experimental cmavo",["ceiling function","floor function","nearest integer function","round down","rounding function","round to nearest integer","round up"],"","","VUhU"],["ji'i'u'u","mekso, at-most-5-ary; rounding function.

In other words, where \"ji'i'u\" really rounds toward or away from $0$, this word rounds toward negative or positive infinity. The behaviors coincide for nonnegative $x$, but differ for $x < 0$; for example, for $x < 0$, a 'negative-type' rounding for \"ji'i'u\" would round toward $0$, which is actually an increase in value (just decrease in absolute value) while remaining negative, whereas a 'negative-type' rounding here would round toward negative infinity, which is a decrease in value (but an increase in absolute value) while remaining negative.

Technically, $x_1$ (therefore, also $x_2$) and $x_3$ are mutually so, as well. However, $x_3$ will typically be used in order to identify the 'side of the family tree/genealogy' being considered and $x_2$ will typically be the focal point at which the several sides of family trees (including the considered one) intersect (being otherwise disjoint); as such, $x_2$'s paternal uncle will not be described as being $x_2$'s father's brother on $x_2$'s side of the tree. In other words, there is a large family tree with at least two 'sides' and they intersect at exactly one node; this node of intersection is canonically to typically be $x_2$ and $x_3$ is canonically to typically be used to designate which of these possible sides is being considered such that $x_1$ belongs to it. (Symmetry is enabled by the fact that the only inferrable family tree is the 'side' produced; the larger family tree is unknown, and so the collection of potential sides amongst which the specification is taken is also unknown). The largest family tree (graph union of all sides of the mentioned relatives) is the graph which the utterer and/or relatives mentioned consider to be the entirety of the family of all the relatives mentioned (plus some near relatives, so long as they belong to exactly one side); thus, it may include marriages, god-children, close friends, and exes, but it is unlikely to span over many generations. For example, maternal and paternal sides of families are considered to be separate sides of the family tree for a child, even if in the distant unknown past, that father and that mother share some sort of familial relationship (even including a biological common ancestor). This word can be used to hint at a path in the graph from $x_1$ to $x_2$, since there exists a path which connects them and which also includes $x_3$; therefore, it can be used to vaguely mean \"my onclic aunt-in-law by my Uncle John\" meaning that the referent is the utterer's Uncle John's wife's sister (or sister in law); use connectives in $x_3$ in order to include (if the connective means \"AND\") more nodes which must have paths (not necessarily the same ones) running through them from $x_1$ to $x_2$.
