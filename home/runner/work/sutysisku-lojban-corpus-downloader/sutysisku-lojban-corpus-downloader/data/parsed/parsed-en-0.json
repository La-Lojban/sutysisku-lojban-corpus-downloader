This is the standard operation for negation in Spanish. \"Multiplicative negation\" means that negatives cancel, but do not intensify, one another (possibly taking a neutral or abstentional state). \"I did not see nothing\" in this mode means that the speaker did indeed see something. Note that multiplicative double-negatives are not necessarily equivalent to affirmatives in general. \"I like cheese\" is an affirmative statement and is not equivalent to \"I do not dislike cheese\", which is a multiplicative double-negative (and which may indicate a reluctant acceptance of cheese or a neutral feeling toward cheese). In this mode, an even number of negatives in a given statement is not negative and an odd number of negatives in a given statement is not positive. This word applies to all negatives in the text, whether they are free words or rafsi. This word also, but less dramatically, applies to affirmations: in additive mode, multiple affirmatives intensify one another (\"I am indeed very much so going!\" is a strongly emphasized positive statement); in multiplicative mode, they simply reduce to a single affirmation (for like example, \"I am going\"). This means that care must be taken: In additive mode, an affirmative marker will partially cancel with a negative particle in some way, reducing its intensity and possibly bringing it to a neutral statement (\"I am indeed - not - going\" is a neutral statement in this mode, similar to \"I may be going\"; English does not really have the ability to express such things); in multiplicative mode, an affirmative coupled with a negative simply reduces to the negative, possibly strengthened by a factor equivalent to the intensity of the affirmer (\"I am indeed not going\" is a clear way of saying that the speaker will not go).","experimental cmavo",["double-negative mode toggle"],"","","NEIhAI"],["nei'au","unary mekso operator: $(-1)^x$","Macro for exponentiating -1 by the input, which is an extremely common term.
