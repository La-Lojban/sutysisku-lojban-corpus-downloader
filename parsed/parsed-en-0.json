Proper {lujvo}-making requires a good grasp of the semantics of the relevant {gismu}; and of {tanru} syntax, especially the scope of various grammatical constructs; knowledge of Lojban morphology and phonotactics to correctly insert y-hyphens where needed and avoid unparseable wordlike forms such as *{tosmabru} and *{slinku'i} (see {valrtosmabru}, {valslinku'i}); and finally, if you want to add your word to the dictionary, facility with the lujvo-scoring algorithm. Making Type 4 {fu'ivla} (or {zi'evla}), on the other hand, presents the challenge of knowing, out of hundreds of wordlike phonological patterns, which will parse as  single-morpheme words and which will not. (For example, the nonce word {kadvati} will parse but *{kazvati} will not; {fra'aso} will but *{fra'asoi} will not; {kadnazbakai} will but {kadnazbackai} is a actually a lujvo.) Making Type 3 fu'ivla is comparatively easy, but still requires knowing how to use hyphen phonemes right and, of course, how to not violate phonotactical rules when lojbanizing foreign words.

This is the standard operation for negation in Spanish. \"Multiplicative negation\" means that negatives cancel, but do not intensify, one another (possibly taking a neutral or abstentional state). \"I did not see nothing\" in this mode means that the speaker did indeed see something. Note that multiplicative double-negatives are not necessarily equivalent to affirmatives in general. \"I like cheese\" is an affirmative statement and is not equivalent to \"I do not dislike cheese\", which is a multiplicative double-negative (and which may indicate a reluctant acceptance of cheese or a neutral feeling toward cheese). In this mode, an even number of negatives in a given statement is not negative and an odd number of negatives in a given statement is not positive. This word applies to all negatives in the text, whether they are free words or rafsi. This word also, but less dramatically, applies to affirmations: in additive mode, multiple affirmatives intensify one another (\"I am indeed very much so going!\" is a strongly emphasized positive statement); in multiplicative mode, they simply reduce to a single affirmation (for like example, \"I am going\"). This means that care must be taken: In additive mode, an affirmative marker will partially cancel with a negative particle in some way, reducing its intensity and possibly bringing it to a neutral statement (\"I am indeed - not - going\" is a neutral statement in this mode, similar to \"I may be going\"; English does not really have the ability to express such things); in multiplicative mode, an affirmative coupled with a negative simply reduces to the negative, possibly strengthened by a factor equivalent to the intensity of the affirmer (\"I am indeed not going\" is a clear way of saying that the speaker will not go).","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"NEIhAI","g":["double-negative mode toggle"]},{"w":"nei'au","d":"unary mekso operator: $(-1)^x$","n":"Macro for exponentiating -1 by the input, which is an extremely common term.
