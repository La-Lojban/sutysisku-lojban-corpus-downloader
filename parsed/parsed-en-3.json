If $X_2 = 0$, then the prime factors with nonzero power are counted without multiplicity (they are counted only uniquely and according to their distinctness, ignoring their exponents unless such is $0$ (in which case, it is not counted)); in other words, under this condition, this word would function as the number-theoretic prime little-omega function LittleOmega$(x_1) =$ Sum$_{p|X_1} (1)$, where: the summation is taken over all $p$, such that all of the bound $p$ must be prime, and \"$|$\" denotes divisibility of the term on the right (second term) by the term on the left (first term).

By default, the macrodigit is interpreted as being written/expressed in some cultural or grammatical default (this default is overridden by {ju'au} if its specifying sumti requires an alternative interpretation for the value of the macrodigits), probably decimal- the interpretation of the string of microdigits produces a number, x; the \"{pi'e}\" implies the denominator to be used in determining the fraction for which x is in the numerator and context or possibly a specified base determines its value- in timekeeping, the interpretation is typically x/60 for certain macrodigits. However, the default for determining the value of x given a string of microdigits might be useful to override (for example, Tsohnai uses an overall factorial base but each macrodigit is written in balanced quinary); this word specifies the base used for interpreting the macrodigit from a string of microdigits. It is placed at the end of the string (possibly before the next \"{pi'e}\") and its scope of effect extends from there, through the string of microdigits, to either the beginning of the number as a whole or the most recent \"{pi'e}\" (whichsoever was more recently uttered). It is to be followed by a sumti (or multiple sumti strung together by connectives) and has its scope of specification terminate with that sumti; in this regard, it works syntactically and semantically exactly like {ju'au}. In fact, {ju'au} can be used outside of the number in order to specify the macrodigit interpretation instead of this word (for example, if its sumti were la .tsonais., this word would not be needed); however, if only a sequence were to have been given as the argument of {ju'au} (such as the factorial sequence) and if some base other than decimal were desired for the interpretation of each macrodigit from the string of microdigits, then this word would be used. If only one macrodigit appears in the number, then this word is equivalent to {ju'au}. In short, the scope of this word is one contiguous string of microdigits, and it influences their interpretation into a macrodigit value in the same way that {ju'au} does. However, if both {ju'au} and this word specify how to interpret a given string of microdigits in the same number (composed of macrodigits), this word overrides the interpretation specified by {ju'au} (but only for this macrodigit); thus, for example, a Tsohnai number can have each of its macrodigits be interpreted in balanced quinary except one, which the speaker specifies via this word, because they know the value but did not want to convert it to balanced quinary (because it may be too large or hard to do so easily), so they instead expressed it in decimal.","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"JUhUhI","g":["long-digit interpretation specifier","macrodigit named base specifier"]},{"w":"ka'ai","d":"{kansa} modal, 1 place; with .../with a companion ...","n":"See also {kansa}","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"BAI","g":["with"]},{"w":"ka'au","d":"mekso unary operator: cardinality (#, | |)","n":"Usually should be reserved for use on sets; if applied to group, it is the cardinality of the underlying set (Which is the order of the group)- but it should probably not be applied to an element of a group.

Therefore, using/under the aforementioned notation and assumptions and specifications, usage of this word in \"$x_{n} x_{n-1} ... x_{m}$ mi'i'au $x_{m-1} x_{m-2} ...$\" outputs an interval which is equivalent to the evaluation of/interval referenced by \"eval(\"$x_{n} x_{n-1} ... x_{m} x_{m-1} x_{m-2} ...$\") {ga'o} {mi'i} {ke'i} $b^{m}$\". Importantly, usage of this word generates an interval, not a specific number (even if such would be elliptical or vague) - meaning, among other things, that equality to such an expression would be set equality, and not numeric equality. Note that the interval which is generated excludes both endpoints but includes the center (which is the number specified by the string with this word ignored in/removed from it). As an example, where \"M\" represents this word: \"2M000\" yields (1000, 3000); meanwhile, \"20M00\" yields (1900, 2100); also, \"19M69\" yields (1869, 2069); likewise, \"1.2M3\" yields (1.13, 1.33). This word/function is useful for dates (example: \"the mid-2000s\" or \"the period of two centuries which is centered on the year 1900\"), ages (example: \"they are in their mid-twenties\", \"they are older teens or young adults (fifteen to twenty-five years of age)\", or \"they are in their middle adult years (thirties or forties)\"), or any estimate wherein the midpoint/expected value/average is known. The interval which is generated is a complete (math jargon) subset of the real numbers - there are no gaps and, in particular, the interval is not discrete (for example: it is not restricted to only the integers). Note that this word does not yield an interval of an arbitrary radius; use \"{mi'i}\" for that. Use a construct similar to \"there exists a $t$ in (the interval) {re} {mu} mi'i'au such that their age is measured to be (approximately) $t$ in years\" in order to express \"they are in their mid-twenties (approximately 24 years old to 26 years old)\"; the full English expression is wordy, but Lojban can make it concise in translation.

This word can also be viewed as creating an object in a ring. Termination of the list is extremely important; under normal interpretations, list entries can themselves have operations applied internally; moreover, multiple indetermimates can be introduced by careful application of this word to a list wherein each entry is itself treated as a polynomial.

The type of the output is a list, not a number; its elements must be extracted in order to be treated as numbers; this is true even if the length of the list is 1.

When it is well-defined (and the inputs, excluding $m$ are fixed by context), denote $z_{m} = -i * ext((A,<),i,n)|_{m}$. Then $ext((A,<),i,n)$ equals a list of length n wherein each entry is an element of $A$ and if n>1, then for any natural number $m<n$, the following is true: $z_{m} < z_{m+1}$; and, moreover, there exists no element $y$ in $A$ such that $z_{m} < -i*y < z_{m+1}$.

An answer is a SE string that is allowed by the selbri and by the subscripts; continuing the example, if the response is 'Ralph went to C from B', one would respond with '.i {setese}'.

Essentially 'se'u'o xi sy' is equivalent to 'se xi li xo poi ke'a cmima sy' (where '{te}' is basically understood as ' se xi li jo'i pa boi ci te'u ', etc.), but the answer can be a complicated ordered sequence/string of SE words; this word complements specifically {fi'a} in the typical/same way that SE complements FA.

Inside the module formed by the \"sei'au\" brackets, at most three sumti (where this counting contracts connected sumti into one) can be specified. The first one is a {mau'au}-{zai'ai} quoted function (which is taken to be the operand of this word); it must be preceded (not necessarily immediately) by {li}; let f be this function. The second and third sumti each are a nonnegative integer (preceded by {li}); call them $n$ and $m$ respectively; $n$ defaults to 1 and $m$ defaults to the next (thus-far unfilled) terbri number for/of the current selbri unless these specifications are overridden by zmico; if the relevant selbri has no terbri following this word, then this default value of $m$ causes this word to have no effect. The $m$th terbri of the selbri to which this construct applies will be passed through f before being filled by any sumti (including {zo'e}, explicit or implicit; terbri numbers start counting at 1 and increase by 1 with each new occurrence) for the next $n$ occurrences of the aforementioned selbri in the discourse (with $n$ = 1 counting the current occurrence; aside: a non-default value of $m$ can thus affect the interpretation of an already-filled terbri of the currently open selbri in an afterthought manner); this counting is only done forward in the discourse/time, including the current selbri, never back through it. Thus, $n$ = 0 effectively neutralizes this word, $n$ being infinite causes the effect to be permanent. f being {zi'a'o} returns the terbri in question to its default value/understanding (according to zmico). It is important to realize that this word does not affect the $m$th terbri of all selbri, just of the one currently open when this word is utterred (no matter where it is positioned/nested in future costructs). If this word is in conflict with another usage of this word over the same terbri, follow the specification applied by the most recent still active occurrence of this construct; this construct is considered to be active for this purpose until its-$n$ occurrences of the appropriate terbri are uttered; thus if the earlier-$n$ is greater than the later-$n$, the later effect takes precedent until it is disactivated, after which point the earlier effect resumes. Define $n$ and  $m$ (and f) outside of the module created by brackets of this word if you wish to reuse them; for the sake of future referencing the value specified within the module, $n$ gets reduced/decremented by 1 at each occurrence of the appropriate terbri until it reaches the value 0 (at which value it remains forever after); if $n$ is a series of connected numbers, this decrementation is applied to each connectand in turn. Use {pi'u} (possibly subscripted) in order to simplify utterances. Especially helpful if f is non-injective. The affected terbri must be referenced by {ce'u} as an operand of f wheresoever it is desired; this reference must be explicit.  Let 'broda' be the currentry open selbri; then this word replaces $broda_m$ with f($broda_m$) in the definition of 'broda' for the next $n$ occurrences of the terbri. For example, if f were {cu'a}, then any sumti which fills $broda_m$ will be understood to be doing so in absolute value.
